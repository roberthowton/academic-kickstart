## The Goal of a Philosophy Paper

---

### Question

What makes a philosophy paper successful?

---
<section>
<h3>Answer</h3>

A successful philosophy paper does two things:

</section>

<section>
1. It makes an <em>argument</em> for a specific <em>claim</em>; i.e., it <em>defends</em> a <em>thesis</em>!
</section>

<section>
2. The argument it makes is <em>intelligible</em> and <em>convincing</em> to the reader as well.
</section>

## Planning a Successful Philosophy Paper

---

<section>
<h3> Step 1: Select a <em>thesis</em> </h3>
</section>

<section>
<h4> Exercise: What theses address the TP1 prompt? </h4>

> What is the objection Elisabeth is raising for Cartesian dualism, and how does Descartes respond to it? Is Elisabethâ€™s objection successful? Why, or why not?

</section>

---

<section>
<h3>Step 2: Develop an <em>argument</em> for that thesis.</h3>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5> 1. Deductive [Must be Valid and Sound!] </h5>

All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. <br><br>

Moose is a dog. Moose does not have fleas. Therefore, not all dogs have fleas.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5> 2. Inductive [Sample Must be Representative!]</h5>

a, b, c, and d are all Fs which are also G. Therefore, <em>all</em> Fs are Gs.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Three forms of argument</h4>

<h5>3. Abductive [Must be Best Available Explanation!]</h5>

Increase in carbon emissions correlates with increasingly rapid climate change; there is no other correlation which could better explain increasingly rapid climate change; therefore, increase in carbon emissions <em>causes</em> climate change.

</section>

<section>
<h4>Exercise: What argument(s) support the theses that address the TP1 prompt?</h4>

(Hint: by identifying the form of argument Descartes is giving, we can develop a strategy for supporting or undermining it.)

</section>

---

<section>
<h3>Step 3: Construct an outline<h3>
</section>

<section>
(Hint: your outline should present the argument in a way that your peers can understand.)
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>I. Introduction</h5>

Introduces the problem/question; draws in the reader; states thesis.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>II. Exegesis [Optional]</h5>

Adds any other relevant information that the reader must know in order to understand the argument to come.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>III. Body</h5>

States, as clearly and succinctly as possible, the argument for the thesis.
</section>

<section>
<h4>Elements of an outline</h4>
<h5>IV. Conclusion</h5>

Provides extremely brief restatement of thesis and argument for it; convinces the reader of the significance of the paper's conclusion(s)
</section>

<section>
<h4>Exercise: Construct an outline for the TP1 thesis you've chosen.</h4>

(Hints: If you're arguing that Descartes' response is successful, why is the most convincing argument against his conclusion incorrect? If you're arguing that his argument is unsuccessful, where does the argument go wrong?)

</section>

---

<section>
<h3>Step 4: Fill in your outline with complete sentences<h3>
</section>

<section>

(Hint: Ideally, the most nested items in each "branch" of your outline will correspond to a single paragraph.)

</section>

## Developing Philosophical Writing Skills

### Tips for Writing Philosophy

- Get to the point! (No "since the dawn of time...")
- Write plainly!
- Use 'I', 'me', 'my'!
- Provide clear transitions: 'therefore', 'however', ...
- **Signpost**: state what you've done; what you're going to do ('I will now argue')

### Improving Philosophical Writing

---
<section>
<h4> 1. Argument reconstructions </h4>

Take an argumentative passage, identify the premises and conclusion, and restate the argument in your own words.
</section>

<section>
<h5>Sample Passage 1: The Cartesian Circle (AT 214)</h5>

<q>My only remaining concern is whether the author does not commit a vicious circle when he says that we have no other basis on which to establish that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is true, than that God exists. But we can be certain that God exists only because we clearly and evidently perceive this fact. Therefore, before we are certain that God exists, we ought to be certain that whatever we clearly and evidently perceive is true.</q>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Sample Passage 2: Malebranche on the one true cause</h5>

<q>The motive force of bodies is therefore not in the bodies that are moved, for this motive force is nothing other than the will of God. Thus bodies have no action; and when a moving ball collides with and moves another, it communicates to it nothing of its own, for it does not itself have the force it communicates. However, a ball is the natural cause of the motion it communicates. A natural cause is therefore not a real and true but only an occasional cause, one that determines the Author of nature to act in such and such a manner in such and such a situation. (213)</q>
