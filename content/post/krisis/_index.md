## Introduction

In several passages of his natural scientific treatises, Aristotle expresses commitment to the thesis that sense-perception (_aisthêsis_) is _kritikê_, discriminative or (better, as I shall argue) _criterial_.^[CITE passages] Though it is nowhere presented as such, this is in fact one of the most controversial claims of his psychology: Aristotle is alone among his contemporaries and predecessors in affirming the thesis, whereas it was explicitly _denied_ by almost all others who considered it ([Text 1]({{< relref "texts.md#text-1-anaxagoras-59b21-dk" >}}), Text 2, Text 3).

Commentators have come increasingly to appreciate the significance of this thesis for Aristotle's psychology. So far, however, no commentators have addressed




## Against recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination:

- Answering these questions leads us to reject two claims central to many recent interpretations of perceptual discrimination in Aristotle:
	1. That Aristotle regards being κριτική as _essential_ to, or partially _definitive_ of, αἴσθησις: see most recently Perälä, but also by Ebert, De Haas [CHECK Corcilius, Herzberg, Johansen]
	2. That Aristotle, in stressing that αἴσθησις is κριτική, is emphasizing that the power to perceive is, in some primary sense, a power to discriminate or tell apart sensible qualities and sensible bodies. (A line of interpretation initially proposed by Ebert but which has been accepted by all [?] subsequent interpreters.)

## In contrast, I'll argue that:

1. The power to discriminate is _not_ a feature of the _essence_ of the senses, but rather a _demonstrable_ feature of them.

2. Aristotle provides two arguments aimed at demonstrating that αἴσθησις is κριτική, one final causal and one formal causal:
	- According to the _final causal argument_, αἴσθησις is and must be κριτική in order to promote the ends for whose sake it belongs to living things that have αἴσθησις:
		- αἴσθησις is present in all animals for the sake of survival and, ultimately, reproduction;
		- the presence of αἴσθησις additionally promotes animals' cognitive function;
		- finally, in humans, αἴσθησις is cited as the capacity from which potential knowers acquire knowledge of the indemonstrable principles of a demonstrative science.
	- According to the _formal causal_ argument, αἴσθησις is κριτική because each sense (αἴσθησις) is a mean state of the opposition present in the qualities each perceives, and the mean is in every case κριτική.

3. Seen in the light of Aristotle's arguments, the conclusion that αἴσθησις is κριτική appears radically different: not an affirmation that perception is the cognition of difference but of the basic fidelity of the senses. For Aristotle, the senses are not only a source of knowledge; perception itself is a form of knowledge. And the basis for this claim is that perception, in its most basic form, is criterial for the presence of the sensible qualities it perceives; that perceivers, by virtue of having the capacity to perceive, occupy a privileged perspective with respect to the sensible objects and qualities of which they are critical.

## Concluding remarks

The foregoing has sketched a fragment of a debate whose origin and terminus far exceed the scope of this paper. At its inception is a pre-Platonic skepticism about the reliability of the senses, at its terminus a sophisticated between skeptics and so-called dogmatists about the status of perception as a "criterion of truth" and source of knowledge. My hope is that this paper has shown that Aristotle's case for the fidelity of the senses is more formative for this debate than we have previously acknowledged.
