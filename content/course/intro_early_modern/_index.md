## Course Description

Philosophy in Western Europe underwent a dramatic shift in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. Spurred by the ongoing revolution in science and the rediscovery of some lost works of Classical Greek and Roman philosophy, philosophers of this period turned away from the scholastic disputes practiced in the universities of Europe to a whole new set of philosophical questions, including: What am I? How do I relate to my body? Is knowledge possible? If so, where does it come from? For proponents of this new approach to philosophy, exploration of these questions did not require extensive education or training, only the exercise of one's inborn rational faculties. For this reason, philosophy in this period also witnessed another revolution: the increasing influence of women philosophers.

This course will introduce you to the major questions and figures of 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century philosophy in Western Europe. We begin with Ren√© Descartes, arguably the most important thinker of the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Descartes' philosophical work posed the questions with which subsequent philosophers would wrestle. After looking at Descartes' answers to these questions, we'll turn to those of his contemporaries and successors, including Malebranche, Cavendish, Leibniz, Berkeley, Locke, and Hume. Finally, we'll close our survey with a look at the most important philosopher of the 18<sup>th</sup> century: Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental philosophy represents the culmination of Descartes' philosophical legacy.


## Course Objectives

This course will emphasize close reading, analysis, and evaluation of basic philosophical works from the early modern period, with the aim of establishing a broad understanding of the philosophical controversies of that period and cultivating the skills necessary for appreciating these and other topics in philosophy. The successful student will demonstrate the ability:

- to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, philosophical ideas and questions,
- to read and critically assess philosophical literature,
- to identify the elements of an argument and assess it for soundness and validity, and
- to apply these skills to novel cases.

The key to success in this course is to keep up with the assigned readings and to attend and participate regularly in class activities.

## Course Components

There are two basic components of this course, **lectures** and **class discussion**. Both components are mandatory, and both are moreover crucial for your success in this course.

### Lectures

The job of my lectures is to introduce you to the theories, concepts, and problems that make up the content of the course. These lectures will be accompanied by slide-show presentations, which I will share with you to use outside of lecture as a guide to reading the assigned texts. Hence, **you will not be expected to come to the lecture having read the material assigned for that day**, but you will be expected to have read the material prior to class discussion.

### Class Discussion

Philosophy is a _discursive_ enterprise: progress in understanding and evaluating philosophical ideas is most effectively made through interpersonal discussion, where you can test, correct, and improve your understanding of those ideas. To help you engage with philosophical ideas in this way, we will meet periodically for  general class discussion of the topics recently introduced in the lecture. Upon arrival at these meetings, students will complete a short **reading reflection** on the texts assigned for that meeting.

## Evaluation

Students will be expected to write two **term tests** and two **term papers**, as well as satisfy requirements for satisfactory **participation** in lectures and discussion meetings. With the exception of University excused absences, which must be supported by official documentation, students are expected to attend all other lectures and discussion meetings.

### Assignments

Final grades will be determined according to the following rubric:

| Assignment      | Percentage of Final Grade |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Term Paper 1    | 15%                       |
| Term Paper 2    | 25%                       |
| Term Test 1     | 20%                       |
| Term Test 2     | 25%                       |
| Participation   | 15%                       |
| **Total**       | **100%**                  |
