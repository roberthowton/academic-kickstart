## Course Description

What are we aware of when we perceive? More often than not, philosophers have sought the answer to this question by looking to the nature of perceptual experience itself, asking for instance whether perception is a relation, what accounts for the phenomenal or qualitative character of perceptual experience, and how perceptual experiences manage to represent a mind-independent reality. In this course we will take a different starting point: the nature of the objects of perception themselves. Our primary focus will be _color_, a phenomenon that seems, paradoxically, at once the most familiar and most incomprehensible feature of the world familiar to our experience. Beginning with the science of color vision and the relation between the familiar hues and the structure of our visual system, we'll go on to consider questions of the nature of the colors, their relation to the physical properties of objects that appear colored, and how visual experience gives us knowledge of them. With any luck, we'll also have opportunity to discuss other sensible qualities, for instance sound.

## Course Objectives

The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in the philosophy of color perception and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and other issues in the philosophy of mind and perception.

## Learning Outcomes

The successful student will demonstrate the ability:

- to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to the philosophy of perception,
- to read and critically assess relevant literature,
- to apply these skills to novel cases.

## Course Components

Students' success in meeting these course goals will be evaluated on the following bases:

- **Undergraduate students** will be expected to write **two short papers** designed to stimulate in-depth philosophical engagement with one of the major topics discussed in class.

- **Graduate students** will be expected to write _either_ one **short paper** and a 12--15 page **final paper** _or_ a 20 page **final paper**. The final paper will address a substantive philosophical issue concerning the philosophy of perception. Topics and literature will be selected in consultation with me.

- Class participation will be evaluated on the basis of the student's answer to periodic **reading response questions**, which will be distributed in advance and must be turned in prior to the start of the meeting in which the relevant reading is to be discussed. (Students may opt out of reading responses with no penalty a maximum of _three_ times; students who do not opt out of three reading responses may use these to replace lower-scoring responses; with the exception of University excused absences, which must be supported by official documentation, students must complete all other reading responses and attend all other class meetings.)

- Finally, students will give at least one 10--15 minute **in-class presentation**. Presentation topics will be selected in consultation with me.
