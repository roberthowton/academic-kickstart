> learning environment, while still ensuring that everyone felt
> comfortable to speak their mind and ask questions. The discussion
> matched with the lectures was engaging and beneficial. Also, the
> information was organized in a chronological way so I could really see
> how all the different theories of mind related to each other and built

> course. **I also became familiar with more technical philosophical
> terms, which will be very helpful for the rest of my education, and
> reading philosophy on my own.**"
