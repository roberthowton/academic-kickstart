### Selected Qualitative Feedback

> "Robbie is friendly and shows great passion for the subject. He is not
> alienating, and has only increased my passion for philosophy. A
> remarkable professor. Also, amazingly lively for a 9 AM class."

> "He was very approachable and accessible. He is a very good
> professor."

> "**The lectures were very organized and I loved that the lecture notes
> were always posted on CourseWeb in advance so that I could focus more
> on what Dr.Â Howton was saying while adding extra notes I felt I
> needed**. He seems very passionate about what he does and provides
> really good examples to clarify sometimes confusing topics."

> "He commanded his lectures extremely well. He spoke strongly and
> clearly. He never seemed to rush through his notes which covered the
> material so well that it almost entirely eliminated the need for
> references beyond the readings. And the readings themselves charted an
> incredibly ordered and logical coarse \[sic\] through out the entire
> semester such that, now at the end, everything we've learned has led
> seamlessly from one place to the next, culminating in the most
> interesting and complex material."

> "He was never hard to approach and always polite and patient when
> explaining concepts."
