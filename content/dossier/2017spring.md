### Selected Qualitative Feedback

> "Each lecture was enthusiastically and clearly expressed. **One thing
> I found very helpful was the 'scribe sheets' made by students as an
> assignment then uploaded as study guides. This provided a great way to
> review old material, make sure nothing was missed, and to catch up on
> a class if one was unable to make it. Though the scribe sheets were
> made by us he guided us through the process and gave corrections and
> supplementations for each one before it was uploaded.** Additionally,
> I found the presentations a helpful way to be exposed to material that
> was more advanced and available for interpretation. His selection of
> the articles was helpful in guiding that exposure"

> "Lectures were excellent, engaging, and immensely detailed. So much
> information was presented during each class meeting, and yet Professor
> Howton's lectures flowed so well and were so effective at reinforcing
> new information as it was introduced that it never felt overwhelming.
> Required homework for each class meeting was more demanding than
> expected, but meant that comprehension of what was being discussed was
> far better (as the assignments required high attentiveness towards
> readings). **Questions were answered phenomenally well in class.
> Seemed to genuinely care about students, both with regard to the
> quality of the learning process and to the students themselves.**
> Exams were occasionally tough but always fair, and constructive
> feedback offered for all assignments was always excellent. Overall,
> fantastic experience."

> "**Your lectures are the most stimulating and entertaining of any
> course I have ever taken outside of my major.** I loved going to
> lecture. It was the highlight of my week. **Also I really liked the
> reading questions system. It ensured that I did the readings every
> week and that I went to lecture. I really don't think I would have
> been successful in this course without that system.** It also was nice
> because it provided a lot of opportunity for points that would not
> have been possible otherwise. Thank you for a fantastic semester!"

> "I am not sure what Robert could do to improve. **I am not sure how
> long Robert has been lecturing, I presume that it cannot be especially
> long based on how old he looksÍ¾ nevertheless, he provided perhaps the
> most exceptional class experience I have ever had.** The greatness of
> Aristotle does not need comment but Robert enhanced the material in
> every way. Often times during the semester, when Robert started
> preaching the gospel, I could not help moving and dancing in my seat."

### Selected Qualitative Feedback

> "Professor Howton always presented the material we covered in a very
> interesting and engaging way. He made lecture an enjoyable
> experience."

> "**The lecture slides he provides are excellent.** The recitations are
> helpful too."

> "**It was great that he had the slides online ahead of time so that i
> was able to take notes on the slides directly during the lecture.**"

> I learned a lot of things that I didn't know about philosophy before,
> which was virtually nothing. **This was the first step I took in
> philosophy and I thought it was very engaging.**

> "Robert's major strengths mainly consisted in the way he could make
> the difficult, abstract material as relatable and clear as possible to
> the students in class. **His lectures made the topics being covered
> much more understandable and easier to relate to, and this greatly
> helped my comprehension of the readings as well as on tests and
> papers.**"

> "Lectures were very organized and the information throughout the
> semester was presented in an organized manner which was very helpful.
> **Robbie is very passionate about what he is teaching and was very
> willing to answer questions and make sure we understood what he was
> teaching during lecture.**"
