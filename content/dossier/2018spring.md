### Selected Qualitative Feedback

> **The professor for this course is one of the best I have had at this university so far.** I like how he lays out the readings in a way thats [_sic_] a lot easier to understand in the powerpoints.

> I liked how the lecture slides were available online before class, so that students could print them out and take notes on information presented by the instructor that were not on the slides.

> The progression of philosophical ideas was easy to follow, and seemed like a story that one could easily remember, rather than a jumbling of fragments of ideas from different people in different times

> Robbie is such a charismatic lecturer, so that really helped me get through the difficult content. Plus, I very much liked how he "prepped" us for the reading that week. Having the background knowledge really made the actual reading much smoother.

> Robert is a great public speaker and knew what he was talking about; he was able to answer any questions that people had over the course of the class. **The powerpoints for the readings SAVED me––they're incredibly helpful!**

> **The lectures and lecture slides were very helpful in understanding the readings. Having the slides available on course web [= Blackboard] was also fantastic.** Teacher was always willing to answer questions regardless of the large class.

> Professor Howton always did a very good job of having examples or analogies that were easy to comprehend for very complex philosophical problems.

> I liked that we were provided the lecture slides to write notes on. Dr. Howton was so passionate and knowledgeable about the material and it really showed.

> I liked that Prof. Howton was really into the material. **You can tell that he is truly passionate about the ideas that he teaches.**

> The professor was constantly stopping after a section and answer any and all questions pertaining to to [_sic_] the material in that section, and did so in a easy to understand way.

> Dr. Howton was very engaged with the material and always enthusiastic in lecture. Though the readings could sometimes be dry, hearing his presentation of the material made it much more understandable
