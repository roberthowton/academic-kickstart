### Selected Qualitative Feedback

> "**He is a great teacher. He really changed my opinion on philosophy for the better.** I enjoyed being in his class."

> "Dr. Howton this year was one of the greatest teachers that I've seen. I've gained a lot of knowledge and new point of views [_sic_] from his teaching skills."

> "**The teacher was really patient towards every question that students have. The slides shown were very useful for the course and for exams. Whenever I had an issue, he was very kind and accurate with helping in term papers and essays.** The only disadvantage was that the texts were really long and in the it felt boring to go till the end of the text."

> "I took this course by pure chance. I'm extremely glad that I did. **I learned so much, I could never thank Robbie enough. KoÃ§ University is lucky to have a person like him, and I am very lucky to have been enrolled in his class.** I really wish more proffessors [_sic_] were like him. Sincerely, thank you Robbie. You have touched my mind and helped me answer some questions. **The relation between real life and the class material was amazing.** I hope to see you again!"

> "Best instructor."
