### Selected Qualitative Feedback

> "Robert Howton, a PhD student in the department of Philosophy
> instructed the entire course. This was the first course he has ever
> taught. That being said, he did not exhibit any anxiety while
> instructing the course. **He was well-versed in each of the covered
> topics, as was made evident in his explanation of the difficult
> subject matter. He provided clear and concise lecture handouts, which
> essentially covered all of the material in the class. Overall, I can
> confidently say that Robert Howton was, by far, my favorite instructor
> at the University of Toronto (PhD candidate, or otherwise).**"

> "Prof. Howton had to teach this course on his own because Prof.
> Whiting was taking leave. In doing so however he was excellent. **He
> provided us with extremely helpful outlines of his lectures, allowing
> me to keep attention on him while also adding things down on the
> handout.** While he did sometimes go a bit fast, the minute anyone
> asked him to repeat a concept he would do so and make it ever the more
> clear. **Though he's a graduate student, I thoroughly enjoyed learning
> with him as my professor. He definitely demonstrated how interested
> and enthusiastic he was about the course material, and I would
> definitely take another course with him in the future.** Great job."

> "Great, explained clearly the topics. Everything was done slowly so
> everyone understands. There was a use of many examples. Small class so
> all questions were answered. Instructor helped out with any problem."

> "Robert Howton is a fantastic instructor. The subject matter was very
> interesting and very intellectually stimulating."

> "Robbie always provided a lot of support and tried to go slowly when
> concepts were unclear."
