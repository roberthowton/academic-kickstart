## Course Description

Philosophy in Western Europe underwent a dramatic shift in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. Spurred by the ongoing revolution in science and the rediscovery of some lost works of Classical Greek and Roman philosophy, philosophers of this period turned away from the scholastic disputes practiced in the universities of Europe to a whole new set of philosophical questions, including: What am I? How do I relate to my body? Is knowledge possible? If so, where does it come from? For proponents of this new approach to philosophy, exploration of these questions did not require extensive education or training, only the exercise of one's inborn rational faculties. For this reason, philosophy in this period also witnessed another revolution: the increasing influence of women philosophers.

This course will introduce you to the major questions and figures of 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century philosophy in Western Europe. We begin with Ren√© Descartes, arguably the most important thinker of the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Descartes' philosophical work posed the questions with which subsequent philosophers would wrestle. After looking at Descartes' answers to these questions, we'll turn to those of his contemporaries and successors, including Malebranche, Cavendish, Leibniz, Berkeley, Locke, and Hume. Finally, we'll close our survey with a look at the most important philosopher of the 18<sup>th</sup> century: Immanuel Kant, whose transcendental philosophy represents the culmination of Descartes' philosophical legacy.

## Course Objectives

This course will emphasize close reading, analysis, and evaluation of basic philosophical works from the early modern period, with the aim of establishing a broad understanding of the philosophical controversies of that period and cultivating the skills necessary for appreciating these and other topics in philosophy. The successful student will demonstrate the ability:

- to state and articulate philosophical questions and ideas, both verbally and in writing, 
- to read and critically assess philosophical literature,
- to identify the elements of an argument and assess it for soundness and validity, and
- to apply these skills to novel cases.

The key to success in this course is to keep up with the assigned readings and to attend and participate regularly in class activities.

## Course Components

There are two basic components of this course, **lectures** and **guided reading**. Both components are mandatory, and both are moreover crucial for your success in this course.

### Lectures

The job of my lectures is to introduce you to the theories, concepts, and problems that make up the content of the course. These lectures will be accompanied by slide-show presentations, which I will share with you to use outside of lecture as a guide to reading the assigned texts. Hence, **you will not be expected to come to the lecture having read the material assigned for that day**, but rather to use what you learn in lecture to help you read the text on your own.

### Guided Reading

After attending lecture, you will be responsible for working your way through the assigned readings. The assigned readings are inevitably difficult: they are texts written centuries ago for audiences very different from us, a fact which accounts as much for their enduring interest as their difficulty for modern readers. The lectures are designed to help you as you work out the meaning of the text for yourself, providing you with the necessary context, key ideas, and outlines of important arguments. Your progress in coming to grips with these texts by a series of **reading responses** assigned for each Unit, which you will turn in for credit one week after the completion of the relevant Unit.

## Evaluation

Your success in meeting these objectives will be assessed on the following bases:

1. Completion of five **reading responses** assigned at the beginning of each Unit and due one week after its completion. The questions assigned in each of the reading responses are designed to orient your reading as well as to gauge your comprehension of the assigned texts.

2. Two 3--5 page **argument analysis** papers, each dedicated to an important passage discussed in lecture.

3. Additionally, students will assessed for **participation** by means of **self-assessments** prepared by the student after each Unit. See below for more information.

### Self-Assessment

Participation is crucial for grasping the content and developing the skills at which this course aims. However, there are more ways to participate in a course than just verbal, in-class participation, which can also be exclusionary, imprecise to grade, and insensitive to students whose circumstances at home are not optimized for remote learning. Rather than traditional participation, we will use self-assessments to reflect on how we have engage with the course in general, or supported others in their engagement, and how we might improve our efforts. To this end, I will be assigning self-assessment quizzes (on Blackboard) at end of every Unit.

I intend to be as inclusive as possible in assessing your efforts to engage with the course. Participation and engagement in the course might include, but are certainly _not limited to_: 
- doing course readings or accessing preparatory material; 
- asking or answering questions in class; 
- contributing to class discussion; 
- engaging with the contributions of others in a charitable and respectful way; 
- discussing course material (in person or online) with others outside of class, including with those not enrolled in this course; 
- starting or contributing to discussions on blogs or social media; 
- seeking out *additional* resources on course topics, such as articles, books, podcasts, or lectures; 
- taking detailed notes on course readings; sharing your academic strategies, tips, and habits with others;
- creating and sharing artistic media relating to course content, such as drawings, paintings, poetry, music, comics, videos, podcasts, or short stories; 
- visiting a museum (virtually or in person) or seeking out artistic works in other ways and sharing how these works relate to course topics; 
- reflecting either in writing or in discussion on the relation of course topics to recent news stories, opinion pieces,or magazine articles or to research, theories, or findings from other disciplines.

Our ability to credit you with these modes of engagement depends on your ability to document them, so please _be detailed_ and, if possible, _provide evidence_!
