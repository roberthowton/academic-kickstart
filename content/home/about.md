I am Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Koç University in Istanbul. I received my PhD in 2017 from the Department of Philosophy and the Collaborative Programme in Ancient and Medieval Philosophy at the University of Toronto. Before coming to Koç, I was Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh.

My research interests lie principally in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and the philosophy of perception. Currently, I am writing on a cluster of topics in Aristotle's psychology and natural science, including: perceptual discrimination, the metaphysics of color and other sensible qualities, the epistemic value of sense experience, and the status of soul as a final cause in the Aristotelian life sciences.
