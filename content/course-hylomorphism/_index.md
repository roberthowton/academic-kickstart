## Course Description

Aristotle famously endorses _hylomorphism_, the thesis that "substances" are composites of form (_morphê_, _eidos_) and matter (_hulê_). Initially, Aristotle seems to have proposed a hylomorphic conception of substance to deal with certain challenges to the possibility of change, in particular _substantial_ change, in which there comes to be a human or a house from what was not one before. But the impact of this thesis on Aristotle's thought extends far beyond the resolution of these challenges, influencing most crucially his theory of being in _Metaphysics_ Z, his explanation of life in _De Anima_, and the whole of the biological theory he develops in the _Parts_ and _Generation of Animals_.

This course will be an in-depth examination of Aristotle's hylomorphism, its theoretical motivations, and its philosophical difficulties. We will read widely from Aristotle's works in metaphysics and natural science, while drawing on both recent scholarly and neo-Aristotelian treatments of Aristotle's account of substance.

## Course Objectives

The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in Aristotle's metaphysics and natural science and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and related issues in ancient and contemporary philosophy.

## Learning Outcomes

The successful student will demonstrate the ability:

- to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to Aristotle's hylomorphism,
- to read and critically assess relevant primary and secondary literature,
- to apply these skills to novel cases.

## Course Components

Students' success in meeting these course goals will be evaluated on the following bases:

- **Undergraduate students** will be expected to write **two passage commentaries** of roughly 7 pages each. The commentaries are designed to stimulate in-depth historical and philosophical engagement with one of the major passages discussed in class and the relevant secondary literature. Undergraduates who earn an A- or higher on their first commentary can petition to write a roughly 7 page **term paper** (Term Paper 2 style; see below) in lieu of a second commentary.

- **Graduate students** will be expected to write three 5--7 page **term papers**, each addressing a substantive interpretive issue concerning Aristotle's metaphysics, natural science, and/or related philosophical issues. These papers are intended to be exercises in advanced philosophical writing, so students will be responsible for submitting substantial **outlines** and **preliminary drafts**, on which I will provide comments aimed at helping the student compose a well-written and cogently argued **final draft**. Additionally, students will be given progressively greater discretion over the subject of their papers over the course of the term:
  - **Term Paper 1** topics will be chosen from a list of prompts given by me.
  - **Term Paper 2** topics may _either_ be chosen from a list of prompts given by me _or_ proposed by the student in consultation with me.
  - **Term Paper 3** topics _must_ be proposed by the student in consultation with me.

- **Participation** will be evaluated on the basis of student participation in discussions both in lecture meetings and outside of lecture meetings in the course chat (see below). 

<!-- - Class participation will be evaluated on the basis of the student's answer to periodic **reading response questions**, which will be distributed in advance and must be turned in prior to the start of the meeting in which the relevant reading is to be discussed. (Students may opt out of reading responses with no penalty a maximum of _three_ times; students who do not opt out of three reading responses may use these to replace lower-scoring responses; with the exception of University excused absences, which must be supported by official documentation, students must complete all other reading responses and attend all other class meetings.) -->

- Finally, undergraduate students will make one, and graduate students two, 10--15 minute **in-class presentations**. Students due to present in a given week will also be required to post three reading questions to the course chat no later than the Tuesday of that week.
