Organon
: lit. "tool, instrument"; a collective name for Aristotle's logico-epistemological treatises:
    -   _Categories_, on predicates

    -   _De Interpretatione_, on things said in combination

    -   _Prior_ and _Posterior Analytics_, on demonstrative scientific knowledge (_epistēmē apodeiktikē_), including Aristotle's categorical logic

    -   _Topics_, on dialectic

    -   _Sophistical Refutations_, on fallacy


## Background: Ontology & Explanation in the _Organon_ {#background-ontology-and-explanation-in-the-organon}


### _Categories_ 1--5 {#categories-1-5}


#### _Cat._ 1: Three semantico-ontological distinctions: {#cat-dot-1-three-semantico-ontological-distinctions}

-   _x_ and _y_ are **homonymous** iff:
    -   _x_ and _y_ have a name (_N_) in common, but

    -   the "definition of being" (_logos tēs ousias_) of _N_ is <span class="underline">different</span> in "_x_ is _N_" and "_y_ is _N_".

-   _x_ and _y_ are **synonymous** iff:
    -   _x_ and _y_ have a name (_N_) in common,

    -   the "definition of being" (_logos tēs ousias_) of _N_ is <span class="underline">the same</span> in "_x_ is _N_" and "_y_ is _N_".

-   _x_ and _y_ are **paronymous** iff:
    -   _x_ and _y_ get their name from the same _N_, but

    -   _x_ and _y_ differ in grammatical category (_ptōsis_).


#### _Cat._ 2: A fourfold division of beings (_ta onta_): {#cat-dot-2-a-fourfold-division-of-beings--ta-onta}

|                     | **Said-of**                            | **&not;Said-of**                       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Present-in**      | Non-Substantial Universals (Knowledge) | Non-Substantial Particulars (Literacy) |
| **&not;Present-in** | Secondary Substances (Human Being)     | Primary Substances (Socrates)          |

-   Some definitions (_Cat._ 5, 2a19--35)...
    -   _N_ is **predicated** of some subject _x_ if (and only if?):
        &forall;M(_M_ is said of _N_ &rarr; _M_ is said of _x_)

    -   _N_ is **said of** some subject _x_ if (and only if?)
        -   "_N_" is (truly) predicated of _x_, and

        -   N's definition is also (truly) predicated of _x_.

    -   _N_ is **present in** a subject  _x_ iff:
        -   _N_ is "in" _x_, not as a part, and cannot be separately from what it is in. (1a24--5)

        -   Neither "_N_" nor its definition is (non-paronymously) predicated of _x_.
            (Socrates is _brave_, not _bravery_.)


#### Mapping said-of and present-in relations {#mapping-said-of-and-present-in-relations}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Said-of relations and genus-species trees

    {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/genus-species.png" >}}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Present-in relations and "kooky objects"

    Kooky object
    : an "accidental" compound of a (primary) substance and an attribute present in that substance, e.g. _the pale man_ or _musical Socrates_.

        {{< figure src="/ox-hugo/kookyobject.png" >}}


### Substance in _Cat._ 5 {#substance-in-cat-dot-5}

>
>
> _Cat._ 5, 2a11--19 (Ackrill tr.)
>
> A substance—that which is called a substance most
> strictly, primarily, and most of all—is that which is neither
> said of a subject nor in a subject, e.g. the [15] individual man
> or the individual horse. The species in which the things
> primarily called substances are, are called secondary
> substances, as also are the genera of these species. For
> example, the individual man belongs in a species, man, and
> animal is a genus of the species; so these—both man and
> animal—are called secondary substances.


#### Characteristics of substance in _Cat._ 5 {#characteristics-of-substance-in-cat-dot-5}

-   Substance is not present in anything:
    -   **Primary substances** are neither said of nor present in anything else as subject.

    -   **Secondary substances** are said of primary substances, but present in nothing.

    -   **Differentia** too are not present in anything as subject, but they are neither primary nor secondary substances...
        -   **Question:** How then do differentia fit into the _Cat._ 2 division of beings?

-   Everything called from them are so-called synonymously.

-   No contrary of substance...
    -   _F_ and _G_ are **contraries** iff &forall;x(Fx&rarr;&not;Gx) &forall;x(Gx&rarr;&not;Fx)

    -   _F_ and _G_ are **contradictories** iff &forall;x[(&not;Fx&rarr;Gx) & (&not;Gx&rarr;Fx)]

-   Substances do not admit of a more and less.

-   "Most distinctive": substances are (1) numerically one but (2) capable of receiving contraries.

### Ontology & Explanation in the _Prior Analytics_ {#ontology-and-explanation-in-the-prior-analytics}


#### Basics of Aristotelian Syllogistic {#basics-of-aristotelian-syllogistic}

-   A **term** (A, B, C, ...) is what is predicated and what it is predicated of in a **premise**.

-   A **premise** is a sentence that affirms or denies one **term** of another:
    -   **Affirmation:** "A belongs to B"

    -   **Denial:** "A does not belong to B"

    -   Premises are distinguished by **quantity** (and **quality**, i.e. necessity, possibility).

        |                | **Affirmation**       | **Denial**                    |
        |----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
        | **Universal**  | A belongs to _all_ B  | A belongs to _no_ B           |
        | **Particular** | A belongs to _some_ B | A does _not_ belong to some B |

        Schematically:

        -   **Universal Affirmative:** AaB

        -   **Universal Negative:** AeB

        -   **Particular Affirmative:** AiB

        -   **Particular Negative:** AoB

-   A **syllogism** is "a _logos_ in which, certain things being posited (i.e., the premises), something else (i.e., the conclusion) results by necessity because these things are so" (24b18--20).
    -   Aristotle's syllogistic is the formal study of what combinations of premises produce syllogisms, using three tools:
        -   Three **rules of conversion** (_APr._ 1.2)
            -   **AeB &rarr; BeA:** If A belongs to no B, B belongs to no A.

            -   **AiB &rarr; BiA:** If A belongs to some B, B belongs to some A.

            -   **AaB &rarr; BiA:** If A belongs to all B, B belongs to some A.
                (Note: Aristotle assumes terms are non-empty!)

        -   Arguments from impossibility (_reductio ad absurdum_)

        -   "I call a syllogism perfect if it requires nothing beyond the things posited for the necessity to be evident."
            -   According to Aristotle, syllogisms of the First Figure are all perfect:

                | Mnemonic | Form                |
                |----------|---------------------|
                | Barbara  | AaB, BaC \vdash AaC |
                | Celarent | AeB, BaC \vdash AeC |
                | Darii    | AaB, BiC \vdash AiC |
                | Ferio    | AeB, BiC \vdash AoC |

            -   Syllogisms in the second and third figures proved by conversion and reduction to one of the "perfect" first figure syllogisms; figures differ according to where the **middle term** (the term that appears in both premises) appears in each premise.
                -   Second Figure

                    | Mnemonic  | Form                |
                    |-----------|---------------------|
                    | Ceasare   | AeB, AaC \vdash BeC |
                    | Camestres | AaB, AeC \vdash BeC |
                    | Festino   | AeB, AiC \vdash BoC |
                    | Baroco    | AaB, AoC \vdash BoC |

                -   Third Figure

                    | Mnemonic | Form                |
                    |----------|---------------------|
                    | Darapti  | AaC, BaC \vdash AiB |
                    | Felapton | AeC, BaC \vdash AoB |
                    | Disamis  | AiC, BaC \vdash AiB |
                    | Datisi   | AaC, BiC \vdash AiB |
                    | Bocardo  | AoC, BaC \vdash AoB |
                    | Ferison  | AeC, BiC \vdash AoB |


### Syllogistic and Explanation {#syllogistic-and-explanation}

Demonstration
: A "knowledge-yielding" syllogism; a syllogism grasp of which imparts scientific knowledge (_epistēmē_) of the conclusion.

    >
    >
    > _Posterior Analytics_ 1.2, 71b9-12 (Barnes tr.)
    >
    > We think we understand (= know scientifically) a thing _simpliciter_
    > (and not in the sophistic fashion accidentally) whenever we think
    > we are aware both that the explanation [10] because of which the

    > to be otherwise.


The syllogistic is a necessary preliminary to the study of demonstration and demonstrative scientific knowledge "because syllogism is more universal than demonstration, for a demonstration is a kind of syllogism, but not every syllogism is a demonstration" (_APr._ 1.4, 28--31)


As the universal patterns of which demonstrations are special instances, Aristotle thinks the syllogistic implies a method for inquiry and explanation in all disciplines:

>
> _Prior Analytics_ 1.30, 46a3--10 (Striker tr.)
>
> So the method is the same for all subjects, in philosophy as well as
> in the technical or mathematical disciplines. For one must discern for
> both terms what belongs to them and what they belong to, and be
> supplied with as many of those terms as possible. One must examine
> them with respect to the three terms, in one way when refuting, in
> another way when establishing something; and when it is a question
> of truth, from the terms that are listed as belonging truly, for dialecti-
> cal syllogisms from premisses according to opinion.

-   The method presupposes the classification of beings similar to the one articulated in the _Categories_:

    >
    >
    > _Prior Analytics_ 1.27, 43a25--43
    >
    > Now of all the things there are:
    >
    > 1.  some are such that they cannot be predicated truly and universally of anything else (for instance, Cleon or Callias, that is, what is individual and perceptible), but other things may be predicated of them (for each of these is both a man and an animal).
    >
    > 2.  Some things are themselves predicated of others , but nothing else is prior and predicated of them.
    >
    > 3.  And some things are both predicated themselves of others and others of them, as man is predicated of Callias and animal of man.
    >
    > That [1] some things are by nature such as to be said of nothing else is clear, for just about every perceptible thing is such as not to be predicated of anything except accidentally---for we do sometimes say that the white thing there is Socrates, or that what is approaching is Callias.
    >
    > But [2] that one also comes to a halt if one goes upwards,  we will explain later; for the moment let this be assumed. (_APo._ 1.3)
    >
    > -   Now with respect to those things one cannot demonstrate that something else is predicated of them (except perhaps as a matter of mere opinion), but only that they themselves are predicated of other things;
    >
    > -   nor can one demonstrate that individuals are said of other things, but only that other things are said of them. But clearly the intermediate things admit of both, for they themselves will be said of others and others of them. And by and large arguments and investigations are mostly concerned with these.
-   What of [3], the terms that are both predicated and predicated of? Aristotle continues:

    >
    >
    > _Prior Analytics_ 1.28 43b1--11 (Striker tr.)
    >
    > So one must select the premisses about each thing in the following
    > way: **first**, set down the thing itself, its definitions, and whatever
    > properties are peculiar to it; **after that**, whatever follows this thing,
    > what is followed by it, and whatever cannot belong to the thing. (One
    > need not select the terms to which the thing itself cannot belong, since
    > the privative premiss converts.)
    >
    > Among the terms that follow one must also distinguish:
    >
    > 1.  those that are predicated in the definition,
    >
    > 2.  those that are peculiar properties,
    >
    > 3.  and those that are predicated as accidents; and among those, which sort is predicated only as a matter of opinion and which according to the truth.
    >
    > For the more such terms one has available, the faster one will hit upon a conclusion, and the more these belong in truth, the more one will hit upon a demonstration.

    -   **Question:** Which of 1--3 are said-of predications, and which are present-in predications?

<!--listend-->

-   With a ready supply of terms, Aristotle argues (_APr._ 1.28) we can construct each kind of proposition (_pons asinorum_):

## Conclusions {#conclusions}

-   The ontology Aristotle presents in _Categories_ is complemented elsewhere in the _Organon_ with a sophisticated methodology for understanding and explaining beings and their attributes. (Most notably in the _Analytics_, but also in the _Topics_.)
-   Conspicuously _absent_ from this ontology and explanatory theory is a method for understanding and explaining _change_, including both changes in the attributes belonging to substances and the coming to be of substances themselves.

    (N.B., considerations of change and coming to be are not wholly absent: see especially _APo._ 2.12.)

-   Outside of the _Organon_, Aristotle will attempt to adapt this method and theory of explanation to accommodate explaining coming-to-be, but before he can do this, he has first to make conceptual sense of the phenomenon of change _itself_.
