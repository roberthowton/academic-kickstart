Organon
: lit. "tool, instrument"; a collective name for Aristotle's logico-epistemological treatises:
    -   _Categories_, on predicates

    -   _De Interpretatione_, on things said in combination

    -   _Prior_ and _Posterior Analytics_, on demonstrative scientific knowledge (_epistēmē apodeiktikē_), including Aristotle's categorical logic

    -   _Topics_, on dialectic

    -   _Sophistical Refutations_, on fallacy


## Background: Ontology & Explanation in the _Organon_ {#background-ontology-and-explanation-in-the-organon}


### _Categories_ 1--5 {#categories-1-5}


#### _Cat._ 1: Three semantico-ontological distinctions: {#cat-dot-1-three-semantico-ontological-distinctions}

-   _x_ and _y_ are **homonymous** iff:
    -   _x_ and _y_ have a name (_N_) in common, but

    -   the "definition of being" (_logos tēs ousias_) of _N_ is <span class="underline">different</span> in "_x_ is _N_" and "_y_ is _N_".

-   _x_ and _y_ are **synonymous** iff:
    -   _x_ and _y_ have a name (_N_) in common,

    -   the "definition of being" (_logos tēs ousias_) of _N_ is <span class="underline">the same</span> in "_x_ is _N_" and "_y_ is _N_".

-   _x_ and _y_ are **paronymous** iff:
    -   _x_ and _y_ get their name from the same _N_, but

    -   _x_ and _y_ differ in grammatical category (_ptōsis_).


#### _Cat._ 2: A fourfold division of beings (_ta onta_): {#cat-dot-2-a-fourfold-division-of-beings--ta-onta}

|                     | **Said-of**                            | **&not;Said-of**                       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Present-in**      | Non-Substantial Universals (Knowledge) | Non-Substantial Particulars (Literacy) |
| **&not;Present-in** | Secondary Substances (Human Being)     | Primary Substances (Socrates)          |

-   Some definitions (_Cat._ 5, 2a19--35)...
    -   _N_ is **predicated** of some subject _x_ if (and only if?):
        &forall;M(_M_ is said of _N_ &rarr; _M_ is said of _x_)

    -   _N_ is **said of** some subject _x_ if (and only if?)
        -   "_N_" is (truly) predicated of _x_, and

        -   N's definition is also (truly) predicated of _x_.

    -   _N_ is **present in** a subject  _x_ iff:
        -   _N_ is "in" _x_, not as a part, and cannot be separately from what it is in. (1a24--5)

        -   Neither "_N_" nor its definition is (non-paronymously) predicated of _x_.
            (Socrates is _brave_, not _bravery_.)


#### Mapping said-of and present-in relations {#mapping-said-of-and-present-in-relations}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Said-of relations and genus-species trees

<!--list-separator-->

-  Present-in relations and "kooky objects"

    Kooky object
    : an "accidental" compound of a (primary) substance and an attribute present in that substance, e.g. _the pale man_ or _musical Socrates_.

### Substance in _Cat._ 5 {#substance-in-cat-dot-5}

>
>
> **Cat. 5, 2a11--19**
>
> A substance—that which is called a substance most
> strictly, primarily, and most of all—is that which is neither
> said of a subject nor in a subject, e.g. the [15] individual man
> or the individual horse. The species in which the things
> primarily called substances are, are called secondary
> substances, as also are the genera of these species. For
> example, the individual man belongs in a species, man, and
> animal is a genus of the species; so these—both man and
> animal—are called secondary substances.


#### Characteristics of substance in _Cat._ 5 {#characteristics-of-substance-in-cat-dot-5}

-   Substance is not present in anything:
    -   **Primary substances** are neither said of nor present in anything else as subject.

    -   **Secondary substances** are said of primary substances, but present in nothing.

    -   **Differentia** too are not present in anything as subject, but they are neither primary nor secondary substances...
        -   **Question:** How then do differentia fit into the _Cat._ 2 division of beings?

-   Everything called from them are so-called synonymously.

-   No contrary of substance...
    -   _F_ and _G_ are **contraries** iff &forall;x(Fx&rarr;&not;Gx)

    -   _F_ and _G_ are **contradictories** iff &forall;x[(&not;Fx&rarr;Gx) & (&not;Gx&rarr;Fx)]

-   Substances do not admit of a more and less.

-   "Most distinctive": substances are (1) numerically one but (2) capable of receiving contraries.
