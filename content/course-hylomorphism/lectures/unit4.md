## 4.1 | Is Substance Matter, Form, or What is From Them? Some Puzzles {#4-dot-1-is-substance-matter-form-or-what-is-from-them-some-puzzles}


### Preliminaries: Aristotle's Metaphysics {#preliminaries-aristotle-s-metaphysics}

Aristotle's _Metaphysics_ (literally "after the _Physics_") is a work on "First Philosophy" or "Theology", what, for Aristotle, amounts to the science of "being _qua_ being". What does this mean?


#### Aristotle's Division of Sciences (_Metaph._ E.1) {#aristotle-s-division-of-sciences--metaph-dot-e-dot-1}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/sciences.png" >}}

Theoretical Sciences
: Sciences that aim at no end beyond understanding itself.
    -   **Physics (Natural Philosophy):** Studies beings that are movable and inseparable from matter _qua_ movable and inseparable (in thought) from matter.
    -   **Mathematics:** Studies beings that are movable and inseparable from matter _qua_ immovable and separable (in thought) from matter.
    -   **Theology (First Philosophy):** Studies immovable, separable being qua immovable and separable.


Question
: What makes _this_ identical to the study of being as such?

-  Aristotle is committed to the existence of a unified science of being...

-  But there is a problem...

    Being is said in many ways!

    >

    > _Metaphysics_ Z.1, 1028a9--12 (Ross tr.)
    >
    > There are several senses in which a thing may be said to

<!--list-separator-->

-  Solution?

    Being has a "primary sense", namely **substance**:

    >
    >
    > _Metaphysics_ Z.1, 1028a12--19 (Ross tr.)
    >
    > While ‘being’ has all these senses, obviously
    > that which is primarily is the ‘what’, which indicates the
    > substance of the thing. For when we say of what quality a
    > thing is, we say that it is [15] good or beautiful, but not that it

    > it is, we do not say ‘white’ or ‘hot’ or ‘three cubits long’, but
    > ‘man’ or ‘God’. And all other things are said to be because

    > primary sense, others qualities of it, others affections of it,
    > and others some other determination of it.

-  Background to the Solution

    Being is spoken of "_pros hen_", i.e. in relation to one, primary referent:

    >
    >
    > _Metaphysics_ Γ.2, 1003a33--b18 (Ross tr.)
    >
    > There are many senses in which a thing may be said to ‘be’, but they are related to one central point, one definite kind of thing, and are not homonymous. [35]
    >
    > -   Everything which is healthy is related to health, one thing in the sense that it preserves health, another in the sense that it produces it, another in the sense that it is a symptom of health, another because it is capable of it. And that which is [1003b1] medical is relative to the medical art, one thing in the sense that it possesses it, another in the sense that it is naturally adapted to it, another in the sense that it is a function of the medical art. And we shall find other words used similarly to these.
    >
    > -   [5] So, too, there are many senses in which a thing is said to be, but all refer to one starting-point; some things are said to be because they are substances, others because they are affections of substance, others because they are a process towards substance, or destructions or privations or qualities of substance, or productive or generative of substance, or of things which are relative to substance, or negations of [10] some of these things or of substance itself.
    >
    > [...]
    >
    > As, then, there is one science which deals with all healthy things, the same applies in the other cases also. [...] It is clear then that it is the work of one science [15] also to study all things that are, qua being.
    >
    > But everywhere science deals chiefly with that which is primary, and on which the other things depend, and in virtue of which they get their names. If, then, this is substance, it is of substances that the philosopher must grasp the principles and the causes.

    Hence the grand conclusion of _Metaphysics_ Z.1 (1028b3--5, Ross tr.)

-  Aside on First Philosophy as Theology

    Question
    : What is "being" in the primary sense?


    Answer
    : Substance, but "there are three kinds of substance" (_Metaphysics_ Λ.1):
        -   **Natural:** i.e., movable, of which there are two kinds:
            -   **Perishable:** Plants, animals, their parts, simple bodies

            -   **Eternal:** Celestial substances

        -   **Immovable:** Unchanging, separable from matter.


    **Immovable substance** is the first principle of all (and, according to many commentators, being in the primary sense):

    >
    > There must, then, be such a principle, whose very substance is

#### What is the nature of substance? {#what-is-the-nature-of-substance}

>
>
> _Metaphysics_ Z.3, 1028b34--1029a6 (Ross tr.)
>
> The word ‘substance’ is applied, if not in more senses, still at least to four main objects; for both **(1) the essence** and **(2) the universal** and **(3) the genus** are thought to be [35] the substance <span class="underline">of each thing</span>, and fourthly **(4) the substratum**.
>
> Now **(4) the substratum** is that of which other things are predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything else. And so we must first determine the nature of this; **for that which underlies a [1029a1] thing primarily is thought to be in the truest sense its substance.** And:
>
> -   in one sense **(4a) matter** is said to be of the nature of substratum,
>
> -   in another, **(4b) shape**, and
>
> -   in a third sense, **(4c) the compound of these**.
>
> By the matter I mean, for instance, the bronze, by the shape the plan of its form, and by the compound of these (the concrete thing) the [5] statue. Therefore if the form is prior to the matter and more real, it will be prior to the compound also for the same reason.

Observation 1
: Aristotle moves quickly from the question "what is substance" to the question "what is the substance <span class="underline">of each thing</span>"? (Cf. the following lines: "We have now outlined <span class="underline">the nature of substance</span>, showing that it is that which is not predicated of a subject, but of which all else is predicated.")
    -   **Question:** Are these questions equivalent?


Observation 2
: Aristotle offers four candidates for an answer to the question(s) "what is substance?" and/or "what is the substance of _x_?":
    1.  The essence of ("what-being-is for") _x_.
    2.  The universal to which _x_ (qua substance?) belongs.
    3.  The genus to which _x_ belongs.
    4.  The substatum of (that which underlies) _x_.
    5.  Procedure of _Metaphysics_ Z :: Aristotle will create problems for _each_ of these candidates, only to propose (in Z.17) an entirely different account of substance grounded in the notion that substance is a _cause of being_.


### Substance as Substratum (Z.3) {#substance-as-substratum--z-dot-3}

Question
: Why cannot the substance of _x_ be identified with that which underlies _x_?


Answer
: If it were, "matter becomes substance":

    >
    >
    > _Metaphysics_ Z.3, 1029a9--32 (Ross tr.)
    >
    > For if this is not substance, it is [10] beyond us to say what else is. When all else is taken away evidently nothing but matter remains. For of the other elements some are affections, products, and capacities of bodies, while length, breadth, and depth are quantities and not substances. For a quantity is not a substance; but the substance is rather that to [15] which these belong primarily. But when length and breadth and depth are taken away we see nothing left except that which is bounded by these, whatever it be; so that to those who consider the question thus matter alone must seem to be substance. **By matter I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor of a [20] certain quantity nor assigned to any other of the categories by which being is determined.**
    >
    > [...]
    >
    > **But this is impossible; for both separability and individuality are thought to belong chiefly to substance. And so form and the compound of form and matter would be thought to be substance, rather than matter.** The substance compounded of both, [30] i.e. of matter and shape, may be dismissed; for it is posterior and its nature is obvious. And matter also is in a sense manifest. But we must inquire into the third kind of substance [i.e., form]; for this is the most difficult.


### Substance as Essence (Z.4--6) {#substance-as-essence--z-dot-4-6}

-   Questions arising:
    -   **Q1:** Are there essences _only_ of substances like Socrates, or can there be an essence of _red_ or _being in Athens_ as well?
        -   **If only of substance:** What defines what it is to be _red_?

        -   **If not only of substance:** Then, absurdy, _red_ would be substance, if substance is essence.

    -   **Q2:** If the essence is the substance of _x_, and if _x_ is identical with its substance, can _x_ be identical with the essence of _x_?
        -   **If yes:** Contradictions abound! (The "pale man" argument...)

        -   **If no:** What would explain the difference between a thing and its essence?


#### Q1 (Z.4) {#q1--z-dot-4}

Answer to Q1
: Essence belongs _primarily_ to substance, but _derivatively_ to items in non-substance categories...

>
>
> 1030a27--b13 (Ross tr.)
>
> Now we must inquire how we should express ourselves on each point, but still more how the facts actually stand. And so now also since it is evident what language we use, **essence will belong, just as the ‘what’ does, primarily and in the simple sense to substance, and in a secondary way to the other categories also,—not essence [30] simply, but the essence of a quality or of a quantity.** For it must be either homonymously that we say these are, or by making qualifications and abstractions (in the way in which that which is not known may be said to be known),—the truth being that we use the word neither homonymously nor in the same sense, but just as we apply the word ‘medical’ when there is a reference to one and the same thing, not meaning one and the same thing, nor yet speaking homonymously; for a patient and [1030b1] an operation and an instrument are called medical neither homonymously nor in virtue of one thing, but with reference to one thing. But it does not matter in which of the two ways one likes to describe the facts; this is evident, that **definition and essence in the primary and simple sense belong to substances. Still they belong to [5] other things as well in a similar way, but not primarily.**


#### Q1 (Z.6) {#q1--z-dot-6}

Answer unclear...

<!--list-separator-->

-  The Pale Man Argument (1031a19--25)

    1.  The pale man is the same as the essence of the pale man ("yes" to Q2)
    2.  The man is the same as the pale man (assumption)
    3.  _So_, the essence of the man is the same as the essence of the pale man.

-  A thing can't be separate from its essence!

    >
    >
    > 1031b28--1032a4 (Ross tr.)
    >
    > The absurdity of the separation would appear also if one were to assign a name to each of the essences; for there would be another essence besides the original one, e.g. to the essence of horse there will belong a second essence. Yet why should not [30] some things be their essences from the start, since essence is substance? **But not only are a thing and its essence one, but the formula of them is also the same, as is [1032a1] clear even from what has been said; for it is not by accident that the essence of one, and the one, are one. Further, if they were different, the process would go on to infinity; for we should have the essence of one, and the one, so that in their case also the same infinite regress would be found. Clearly, then, each primary and self-subsistent thing is one and the same as its essence.**
