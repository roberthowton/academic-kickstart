_Physics_ I is devote to the subject of "principles" (_archai_ pl., _archē_) of natural science.

Archē
: beginning, origin, source (e.g. of motion)

### Preliminary Results: _Physics_ 1.5--6 {#preliminary-results-physics-1-dot-5-6}

-   Coming-to-be is always between _contraries_.

-   Hence, the number of the principles cannot be one, since there is no contrary to one...

-   So the principles are either two or three, "but whether two or three is a question of considerable difficulty".

## 2.2 | A Solution to the Puzzles {#2-dot-2-a-solution-to-the-puzzles}


### _Physics_ 1.7 {#physics-1-dot-7}

-   Aim of the chapter: to establish "the number and nature of the principles" of coming to be (_to genēsthai_).

-   _How?_ By analyzing the different ways in which things are _said_ to come to be.


#### Analysis of Coming-to-Be {#analysis-of-coming-to-be}

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.7, 189b32--34 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> We say that ‘one thing comes to be from another thing, and something from something different', in the case both of simple and of complex things.

-   A. distinguishes 3 ways of characterizing a single episode of coming to be.
    1.  "Socrates (the human being) becomes musical"

    2.  "That which is not musical becomes musical"

    3.  "Non-musical Socrates becomes musical Socrates"

-   First Pass:
    -   In (1) and (2), both "that which becomes" and "what it becomes" are **simple**.

    -   In (3), both "that which becomes" and "what it becomes" are **complex** (or **combined**, _sunkeitai_)

|            | "That Which Becomes" | "What It Becomes" |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| _Simple_   | Socrates             | Musical           |
| _Simple_   | The Non-Musical      | Musical           |
| "Combined" | Non-Musical Socrates | Musical Socrates  |

-   Simple cases, in detail:

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.7, 190a9--13 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> When a simple thing is said to become something, in one case it survives [10] through the process, in the other it does not. For the man remains a man and is such even when he becomes musical, whereas what is not musical or is unmusical does not survive, either simply or combined with the subject.

Question
: In which simple case of coming-to-be does "that which becomes" survive (lit., "remain, persist"; _hupomenon_)?


Answer:
    -   **Socrates** survives coming to be musical.

    -   **The Non-Musical** does not survive coming to be musical.


#### Two Conditions on Coming to Be {#two-conditions-on-coming-to-be}

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.7, 190a13--21 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> These distinctions drawn, one can gather from surveying the various cases of becoming in the way we are describing that there must always be an underlying [15] something, namely that which becomes, and that this, though always one numerically, in form at least is not one. (By ‘in form’ I mean the same as ‘in account’.)...
>
> One part survives, the other does not: what is not an opposite survives (for the man survives), but [20] not-musical or unmusical does not survive, nor does the compound of the two, namely the unmusical man.

Subject Condition (SC)
: In every case of coming to be, there must be some underlying subject, _s_, such that it is true '_s_ comes to be...'.


Persistance Condition (PC)
: In every case of coming to be, the underlying subject must remain **one in number**, although not **one in form** or **logos**.
    -   Cf. Aristotle's account of numerical unity in _Metaphysics_ &Delta;:

>
>
> _Metaphysics_ &Delta; 6, 1017a30--34 (Ross tr.)
>
> Again, some things are one in number, others in species,
> others in genus, others by analogy; in number those whose
> matter is one, in species [= form] those whose formula is one, in genus
> those to which the same figure of predication applies, by
> analogy those which are related as a third thing is to a fourth.


#### Varieties of Coming to Be {#varieties-of-coming-to-be}

>
>
> Things are said to come to be in different ways. In some cases we do not use the expression ‘come to be’, but ‘come to be so-and-so’. Only substances are said to come to be without qualification.

Qualified Coming to Be
: _s_ comes to be _F_ (for some predicable _F_ in a non-substance category)


Unqualified Coming to Be
: _s_ comes to be (or: _s_ comes to be _an F_, for some kind of substance _F_)


#### Applying SC and PC {#applying-sc-and-pc}

-   Subject Condition applies to both qualified and unqualified coming to be.

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.7, 190a33--b5 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> Now in all cases other than substance it is plain that there must be something underlying, namely, that which becomes. For when a thing comes to be of such a quantity or quality or in such a relation, time, or place, a subject is always [35] presupposed, since substance alone is not predicated of another subject, but everything else of substance.
>
> But that substances too, and anything that can be said to be without [190 b 1] qualification, come to be from some underlying thing, will appear on examination. For we find in every case something that underlies from which proceeds that which comes to be; for instance, animals and plants from seed.

Question
: What about PC?
    -   **Qualified Coming to Be:** Of course! It is the substance, or _tode ti_:

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.7, 190b24--28 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> Now the subject is one numerically, though it is two in form. (For there is the man, the gold—in general, the countable **matter**; for it is more of the nature of a [25] ‘this’, and what comes to be does not come from it accidentally; the privation, on the other hand, and the contrariety are accidental.)

Unqualified Coming to Be
: The "matter" of substance/subject of unqualified coming to be is knowable on analogy to the matter of qualified comings to be:

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.7, 191a9--12 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> The underlying nature can be known by analogy. For as the bronze is to the [10] statue, the wood to the bed, or the matter and the formless before receiving form to any thing which has form, so is the underlying nature to substance, i.e. the ‘this’ or existent.

-   Initial formulation of **matter**:

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.9, 192a31--33 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> For my definition of matter is just this—the primary substratum of each thing, from which it comes to be, and which persists in the result, not accidentally.


#### Resolution to the Puzzle {#resolution-to-the-puzzle}

-   All coming to be is complex in that which comes to be:

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.7, 190b11--15 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> Thus, from what has been said, whatever comes to be is always complex. There is, on the one hand, something which comes to be, and again something which becomes that—the latter in two senses, either the subject or the opposite. By the opposite I mean the unmusical, by the subject, man; and similarly I call the absence of shape or form or order the opposite, and the bronze or stone or gold the [15] subject.

-   What comes to be is the **Form** (_morphē_), e.g. Musical

-   What comes to be is always a "compound" (_suntheton_) involving:
    -   The **Subject** (_hupokeimenon_), e.g. Socrates

    -   The **Opposite** or **Privation**, e.g. Non-Musical

-   Hence, there are (depending on how one describes the coming to be) either two or three principles:

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.7, 190b29--191a2 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the principles to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense in which the contraries are the [30] principles—say for example the musical and the unmusical, the hot and the cold, the tuned and the untuned—and a sense in which they are not, since it is impossible for the contraries to be acted on by each other. But this difficulty also is solved by the fact that what underlies is different from the contraries; for it is itself not a [35] contrary. The principles therefore are, in a way, not more in number than the contraries, but as it were two; nor yet precisely two, since there is a difference of [191 a 1] being, but three. For to be man is different from to be unmusical, and to be unformed from to be bronze.


### _Physics_ 1.8 {#physics-1-dot-8}

Aim of the chapter
: to show that _only_ this analysis of coming to be can solve "the difficulty of the early thinkers, as well as our own".


#### A Dilemmatic Argument {#a-dilemmatic-argument}

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.8, 191a25--31 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> The first of those who studied philosophy ... say that none of the things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence, because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not, both of which are impossible.
>
> For what is cannot come to be [30] (because it is already), and
>
> from what is not nothing could have come to be (because something must be underlying).

-   If _x_ comes to be, it must come to be either
    -   from what is, or

    -   from what is not.

-   _x_ cannot come to be from what is, since what-is already _is_

-   _x_ cannot come to be from what-is-not, since something must be underlying (SC, no generation _ex nihilo_)

-   _Therefore_, it is not the case that _x_ comes to be.


#### The Aristotelian Intervention {#the-aristotelian-intervention}

Distinguish (1) coming to be from what is not _without qualification_ (which is impossible) from (2) coming to be from what is _not-F_, where _F_ is incidental to what something comes to be from:

>
>
> A doctor builds a house, not qua doctor, but qua housebuilder, and turns gray, not qua [5] doctor, but qua dark-haired. On the other hand he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor. But we are using words most appropriately when we say that a doctor does something or undergoes something, or becomes something from being a doctor, if he does, undergoes, or becomes qua doctor. Clearly then also to come to be so-and-so from what is not means ‘qua what is not’.

The _Qua_ Operator
: _x_ does &phi; <span class="underline">qua F</span> iff _x_ does &phi; <span class="underline">in _x_'s capacity as (an) F</span>


#### Responding to the Dilemma {#responding-to-the-dilemma}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Disarming the Second Horn

    Recall: that which comes to be is complex, including both **subject** (which survives as a constituent of that which comes to be) and **privation** (which is something which is not and does not survive).

    >
    >
    > _Physics_ 1.8, 191b13--17 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
    >
    > We ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing can be said without qualification to come from what is not. But nevertheless we maintain that a thing may come to be from what is not in a qualified sense, i.e. accidentally. For a [15] thing comes to be from the privation, which in its own nature is something which is not—this not surviving as a constituent of the result. Yet this causes surprise, and it is thought impossible that something should come to be in the way described from what is not.

<!--list-separator-->

-  Disarming the First Horn

    Recall: the subject in every case comes to be _F_ from being _not-F_:

    >
    >
    > _Physics_ 1.8, 191b17--25 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
    >
    > In the same way we maintain that nothing comes to be from what is, and that what is does not come to be except accidentally. In that way, however, it does, just as animal might come to be from animal, and an animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind. Thus, suppose a dog to come to be from a dog, or a horse [20] from a horse. The dog would then, it is true, come to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a certain kind) but not as animal, for that is already there. But if anything is to become an animal, not accidentally, it will not be from animal; and if what is, not from what is—nor from what is not either, for it has been explained that [25] by ‘from what is not’ we mean qua what is not.


### Lingering Questions {#lingering-questions}

Details of Unqualified Coming to Be
: What is the subject of substantial generation? What is the relevant privation? Isn't it the case that substances lacks contraries (_Cat._ 5)?


A Puzzling Reference
: A. claims that the same dilemma has been solved elsewhere in terms of **potentiality** (_dunamis_) and **actuality** (_energeia_). _Where, and how?_

>
>
> _Physics_ 1.8, 191b27--29 (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> This then is one way of solving the difficulty. Another consists in pointing out that the same things can be spoken of in terms of potentiality and actuality. But this has been done with greater precision elsewhere.


## 2.3 | Substantial vs. Non-Substantial Coming to Be {#2-dot-3-substantial-vs-dot-non-substantial-coming-to-be}


### Basic Notions {#basic-notions}


#### Kinds of Coming to Be/Passing Away {#kinds-of-coming-to-be-passing-away}

Coming-to-be/generation
: _to genēsthai_, _genesis_

Passing away/corruption
: _phthora_

Cf. _GC_ 1.4, 319b30--320a2

-   Qualified
    -   **Growth/Diminution:** Change of contraries (_metabolē tēs enantōseōs_) in the category of quantity

    -   **Locomotion:** Change of contraries in the category of place

    -   **Alteration:** Change in the category of "affection (_pathos_) and quality"

-   Unqualified
    -   **Generation/Destruction:** Change in which "nothing persists of which the other is generally an affection or accident".

    -   **Question:** Is this account of unqualified coming to be consistent with the _Physics_ 1 account? Recall:
        -   **Subject Condition (SC):** In every case of coming to be, there must be some underlying subject, _s_, such that it is true '_s_ comes to be...'.

        -   **Persistance Condition (PC):** In every case of coming to be, the underlying subject must remain **one in number**, although not **one in form** or **logos**.


#### Basics of Aristotelian Mereology {#basics-of-aristotelian-mereology}

Elements
: That into which all bodies are ultimately divided, but which are not themselves divided into anything different in kind (_Metaph._ 1014a32--35)


Homoiomeres
: Lit. "same-parts"; compound bodies of which the parts are the same in kind as the whole (e.g. flesh, bone, sinew, blood)


Functional Parts (_organa_)
: Compound bodies defined in terms of their function, and whose parts are not the same in kind as the whole (e.g., nose, hand)


Substances
: Compound bodies not present in anything else as part.


#### Transformation of the Elements {#transformation-of-the-elements}

Sublunary Aristotelian Simple Bodies (&asymp; Elements)
: Earth, Air, Fire, Water


Primary Differentia of Simple Bodies
: Hot and Cold, Wet and Dry
    -   **Fire:** Hot + Dry

    -   **Air:** Hot + Moist

    -   **Water:** Cold + Moist

    -   **Earth:** Cold + Dry


Reciprocal Transformation of the Elements
: The coming to be of the elemental bodies is cyclical, effected by a replacement of a single pair of contraries between one element and the other.
    -   Air comes to be from Fire by the replacement of Dry with Moist

    -   Water comes to be from Air by the replacement of Cold with Hot

    -   Earth comes to be from Water by the replacement of Moist with Dry

    -   Fire comes to be from Earth by the replacement of Cold with Hot

<!--listend-->

Question
: Is elemental transformation possible without **prime matter**?


### The Tasks of _GC_ 1.1--4 {#the-tasks-of-gc-1-dot-1-4}

>
>
> _GC_ 1.1, 314a1--5 (Williams tr.)
>
> Our task now is:
>
> 1.  to pick out the causes and definitions of generation and corruption common to all those things which come to be and perish in the course of nature; and
> 2.  secondly to investigate growth and alteration, asking what each of them is, and whether we are to suppose that the nature of alteration and generation is the same or different, as they are certainly distinguished in name.

-   _GC_ 1.1--3 are concerned principally with Task 1, specifically with articulating a basic account of unqualified generation and corruption

-   GC 1.4--5 are concerned principally with Task 2, distinguishing unqualified generation from both alteration and growth
-   Why is Task 2 so pressing?

-   As A. tells us at the end of _GC_ 1.2:

>
>
> _GC_ 1.2 317a17--26 (Williams tr.)
>
> Nevertheless, coming to be simpliciter, i.e. absolutely, is not defined by aggregation and segregation, as some say; nor is change in what is continuous the same as alteration. This is just where all the mistakes are made. Coming to be and ceasing to be simpliciter occur, not in virtue of aggregation and segregation, but when something changes from this to that as a whole. These people think that all such change is alteration, but there is in fact a distinction. **For within the substratum there is something which corresponds to the definition and something which corresponds to the matter. When, therefore, the change takes place in these it will be generation or corruption: when it takes place in the affections, accidentally, it will be alteration.**


### The Basic Model of Generation in _GC_ 1.1--3 {#the-basic-model-of-generation-in-gc-1-dot-1-3}

Answers 2 questions:

1.  What is generation/corruption without qualification (or absolutely, or _simpliciter_)? Why is it that some coming to be is absolute, while some is not?

>
>
> _GC_ 1.3, 317b12--34 (Williams tr.)
>
> The dilemmas that arise concerning these matters and their solutions have been set out at greater length elsewhere, but it should now again be said by way of summary that in one way it is from what is not that a thing comes to be simpliciter, though in another way it is always from what is; for that which is potentially but is not actually must pre-exist, being described in both these ways.
>
> But even when these distinctions have been made, there remains a question of remarkable difficulty, which we must take up once again, namely, how is coming to be simpliciter possible, whether from what is potentially or some other way. One might well wonder whether there is coming to be of substance and the individual, as opposed to quality, quantity, and place (and the same question arises in the case of ceasing to be). For if something comes to be, clearly there will exist potentially, not actually, some substance from which the coming to be will arise and into which that which ceases to be has to change. Now will any of the others belong to this actually?
>
> What I mean is: Will that which is only potentially individual and existent, but neither individual nor existent simpliciter, have any quality or quanity or place?
>
> 1.  If it has none of these, but all of them potentially, (a) that which in this sense is not will consequently be separable, and further, (b) the principal and perpetual fear of the early philosophers will be realized, namely, the coming to be of something from nothing previously existing.
>
> 2.  But if being individual and a substance are not going to belong to it while some of the other things we have mentioned are, the affections will, as we have remarked, be separable from the substances.

1.  If there is unqualified generation/corruption, why does it persist? Why doesn't the total quantity of bodies continually shrink into non-existence?

>
>
> _GC_ 1.3, 318b33--319a3 (Williams tr.)
>
> We have now stated the reason why there is such a thing as generation simpliciter, which is the corruption of something, and such a thing as corruption simpliciter, which is the generation of something: it is due to a difference of matter:
>
> -   either in respect of its being substance or not being substance,
> -   or in respect of its being more or less so,
> -   or because in the one case the matter from which or to which the change takes place is more perceptible and in the other case less perceptible.

Question
: How does this account of absolute generation apply to the transformation of the elements?


### Distinguishing Absolute Generation from Alteration (_GC_ 1.4) {#distinguishing-absolute-generation-from-alteration--gc-1-dot-4}

>
>
> _GC_ 1.4, 319b8--21 (Williams tr.)
>
> The substratum is one thing and the affection whose nature is to be predicated of the substratum another, and either of them can change.
>
> Alteration
> : So it is alteration when the substratum remains, being something perceptible [i.e., a _tode ti_ or individual] but change occurs in the affections which belong to it, whether these are contraries or intermediates. For example, the body is well then ill, but remains the same body; the bronze is now round, now a thing with corners, but remains the same [sc. bronze].
>
>
> Generation

> [I] In those things in which some affection from among a pair of contraries remains the same in both what comes to be and what is destroyed---for instance, when water [comes to be] from air, assuming both are transparent or ~~cold~~ [moist?]---the other, into which it changes, must not be an affection of it. If it is, it will be [a case of] alteration, as [when] the musical person perishes and the unmusical person comes to be, the person remains the same.
>
> [II] **Hence if _musical_ and _unmusical_ were not _per se_ affections of this [sc. the person], we would have generation of the latter and passing away of the former.** This is why they are affections of a person, whereas of _musical person_ and _unmusical person_ we have generation and destruction. As it is, however, this is an affection of what remains, for which reason [transformations] of this sort are [cases of] alteration.

Upshot of [I]
: On pain of being cases of alteration, it cannot be supposed that the persisting subject of elemental transformations is the quality that inheres in both what comes to be and what perishes.


Upshot of [II]
: Despite the superficial similarity in the locutions (1) "the musical person comes to be the unmusical person" and (2) "the hot moist comes to be the cold moist", they describe two ontologically distinct changes:
    -   In (1), the affections _musical_ and _unmusical_ are affections of the person _as such_, which therefore persists through the alteration as subject.

    -   In (2), however, the affections _hot_ and _cold_ are affections of the moist only _incidentally_, in the way the pale thing (the person who happens to be pale) is musical or unmusical. Hence it is wrong to suppose that the moist is a subject of predication, much less that it persists through the transition from hot to cold.


### Two Interpretive Strategies (Pros and Cons) {#two-interpretive-strategies--pros-and-cons}

Question
: What, if anything, is the subject of which _moist_, _hot_, and _cold_ are predicated?
    -   **First air, then water:** Coheres with A.'s denial of a persistent subject in unqualified generation, but at the cost of treating elemental transformation (and all substantial coming-to-be) as a process of "sheer replacement".

    -   **Prime matter:** Avoids the "sheer replacement" model, and perhaps enjoys some textual support, but the metaphysical victory is pyrrhic: what sort of improvement is it to say that water comes to be from pure potentiality?
