_Physics_ I is devote to the subject of "principles" (_archai_ pl., _archē_) of natural science.

Archē
: beginning, origin, source (e.g. of motion)


### Principle is one {#principle-is-one}


#### Either motionless... {#either-motionless-dot-dot-dot}

    What-is (the principle) is one, and motionless, but _infinite_.

-  Thales (everything is generated from water)

-  Anaximenes (everything is generated from air, though condensation and rarifaction)

-  Heraclitus (everything is fire)


### Principles are more than one {#principles-are-more-than-one}


#### Anaximander {#anaximander}

All things come from _to apeiron_ (lit., the unbounded)


#### Empedocles {#empedocles}

-   One: the cosmos is in an eternal cycle of combination and separation, governed by the contrary principles Love and Strife

-   Many: everything comes about from the combination and separation of the four "roots", earth, air, fire, and water, by Love and Strife

### Preliminary Results: _Physics_ 1.5--6 {#preliminary-results-physics-1-dot-5-6}

-   Coming-to-be is always between _contraries_.

-   Hence, the number of the principles cannot be one, since there is no contrary to one...

-   So the principles are either two or three, "but whether two or three is a question of considerable difficulty".
