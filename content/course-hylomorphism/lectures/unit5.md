## 5.1 | Soul as the Form of a Living Body {#5-dot-1-soul-as-the-form-of-a-living-body}

Recall
: Aristotle's answer to the central ontological question, "what is substance?" or "what is the substance of _x_?", is that **substance is a cause of being**, understood here as **form in its role as efficient and/or final cause** of _x_.


Question
: How does this this conception of substance as both form and cause of being influence Aristotle's approach to natural science, in particular, his zoology or science of animal life?

### The Project of _De Anima_ {#the-project-of-de-anima}

Aim
: To determine the essence and attributes of soul.

>
>
> _DA_ 1.1, 402a1--8 (Shields tr.)
>
> We count cognition among the fine and honourable things, and suppose that one kind of cognition is finer and more honourable than another owing to its precision or because of its having better and more marvellous objects; and for both these reasons we may reasonably place an inquiry into the soul into the premier class of study. **It also seems that research into the soul contributes greatly to truth in general, and most especially to truth about nature. For the soul is a sort of first principle of animals. We aim to consider and ascertain its nature and essence, and then its properties, of which some seem to be affections peculiar to the soul itself, while others belong to animals as well because of the soul.**

Method
: By studying both the form and matter of living things, as a natural scientist would!

>
>
> _DA_ 1.1, 402b16--29 (Shields tr.)
>
> And it would seem that all the affections of the soul involve the body---anger, gentleness, fear, pity, courage, as well as joy, and loving and hating. For at the same time as these, the body is affected in some way. This is shown by the fact that sometimes, even though strong and evident affections are present, we are not provoked or made afraid, while at other times we are moved by something small and obscure, whenever the body is agitated and in the condition it is in when angry. This is even clearer from the fact that sometimes though nothing frightful is present, people come to have the affections of a frightened person.
>
> If this is so, it is clear that the affections are accounts in matter. Consequently, definitions will be of this sort, for example: 'being angry is (1) a sort of motion (2) of a body of such a sort, or of a part or capacity of a body, (3) brought about by this (4)  for the sake of that.' And for these reasons, a consideration of the soul, either all souls or this sort of soul, is already in the province of the natural scientist.


### Aristotle's Definition of Soul in _De Anima_ 2 {#aristotle-s-definition-of-soul-in-de-anima-2}

Aristotle's postive account of soul begins in Book 2 of _De Anima_, which begins somewhat predictably but marks a radical change in the focus of psychological investigation. In summary:

_De Anima_ 2.1
: Soul is the form and first actuality of an organic body, a body having the potential for life.

_De Anima_ 2.2
: This can serve only as an "outline" account of soul, since "living is said in many ways".

_De Anima_ 2.3
: To formulate a "scientific" definition of soul---one that explains how soul operates as the cause of life---we must turn our attention to the principal _capacities_ of soul, including nutrition, reproduction, perception, locomotion, and thought.


#### The Outline Account of Soul in _De Anima_ 2.1 {#the-outline-account-of-soul-in-de-anima-2-dot-1}

>
>
> _DA_ 2.1, 412a 5--22 (Shields tr.)
>
> We say that among the things that exist one kind is substance, and that one sort is substance as matter, which is not in its own right some this; another is shape and form, in accordance with which it is already called some this; and the third is what comes from these. Matter is potentiality, while form is actuality; and **actuality is spoken of in two ways, first as knowledge is, and second as contemplating is.**
>
> Bodies seem most of all to be substances, and among these, natural bodies, since these are the principles of the others. Among natural bodies, some have life and some do not have it. By 'life' we mean that which has through itself nourishment, growth, and decay.
>
> It would follow that every natural body having life is a substance, and a substance as a compound. But since it is also a body of this sort-for it has life-the soul could not be a body; for the body is not among those things said of a subject, but rather is spoken of as a subject and as matter. **It is necessary, then, that the soul is a substance as the form of a natural body which has life in potentiality. But substance is actuality; hence, the soul will be an actuality of a body of such a sort.**

Two refinements:

1.  Soul is the actuality in the way _knowledge_ is (= **first actuality**) rather than the way _contemplating_ is (= **second actuality**):

>
>
> _DA_ 2.1, 412a23--29 (Shields tr.)
>
> Actuality is spoken of in two ways, first as knowledge is, and second as contemplating is. **Evidently, then, the soul is actuality as knowledge is. For both sleeping and waking depend upon the soul's being present; and as waking is analogous to contemplating, sleeping is analogous to having knowledge without exercising it. And in the same individual knowledge is prior in generation. Hence, the soul is the first actuality of a natural body which has life in potentiality.**

1.  A body having the potential for life is an _organic_ (functionally organized) body:

>
>
> _DA_ 2.1, 412b1--6 (Shields tr.)
>
> This sort of body would be one which is organic. And even the parts of plants are organs, although altogether simple ones. For example, the leaf is a shelter of the outer covering, and the outer covering of the fruit; and the roots are analogous to the mouth, since both draw in nourishment. Hence, **if it is necessary to say something which is common to every soul, it would be that the soul is the first actuality of an organic natural body**.

<!--list-separator-->

-  A Complication: the "Ackrill Problem"

    -   To be the material cause of a process of generation, the body must be capable of receiving contrary forms.

    -   According to _DA_ 2.1, however, the body seems to be _necessarily_ enformed with soul; a dead body, or a body (or body part) lacking soul is a body only _homonymously_:

        >
        >
        > _DA_ 2.1, 412b25--27 (Shields tr.)
        >
        > The body which has cast off its soul is not a being which is potentially such as to be alive; this is rather the one that _has_ soul. The seed, however, and the fruit, is such a body (= a body potentially such as to be alive?) in potentiality.

    -   How, then, can the body be the matter for soul?


#### The Homonymy of Life in _De Anima_ 2.2 {#the-homonymy-of-life-in-de-anima-2-dot-2}

The account of soul offered in _DA_ 2.1 is however only an "outline" or "general" account of soul, not a scientific definition specifying its _essence_. Why?

>
>
> _De Anima_ 2.2, 413a11--20 (Shields tr.)
>
> Because what is sure and better known as conforming to reason comes to be from what is unsure but more apparent, one must try to proceed anew in this way concerning the soul. **For it is not only necessary that a defining account make clear the that, which is what most definitions state, but it must also contain and make manifest the cause. As things are, statements of definitions are like conclusions. For example: 'what is squaring? It is an equilateral rectangle being equal to an oblong figure.' But this sort of definition is an account of the conclusion: the one who states that squaring is the discovery of a mean states the cause of the matter.**

To see what Aristotle has in mind here, we need to appreciate a difficulty for the science of soul that Aristotle raised back in _DA_ 1.1:

>
>
> _DA_ 1.1, 402b5--8 (Shields tr.)
>
> And one must take care not to overlook the question of whether
>
> -   there is one account of soul, as there is one account of animal,
>
> or whether
>
> -   there is a different account for each type of soul, for example, of horse, of dog, of man, of god, while the universal animal is either nothing or is posterior to these;
>
> and it would be the same if any other common thing were being predicated.

In _DA_ 2.2, Aristotle offers reason for thinking that "there is a different account of each type of soul", namely that _living is said in many ways_:

>
>
> _DA_ 2.2, 413a21--25 (Shields tr.)
>
> We say, then, taking up the beginning of the inquiry, that what is ensouled is distinguished from what is not ensouled by living. **But living is spoken of in several ways.** And should even one of these belong to something, we say that it is alive: reason, perception, motion and rest with respect to place, and further the motion in relation to nourishment, decay, and growth.

Specifically:

Nutrition (Growth, Decay, Reproduction)
: Belongs to everything that is said to live, including **plants** and **animals**.


Perception
: Belongs to **animals** but not to **plants**.


Locomotion
: Belongs to _some_ **animals**.


Reason
: Belongs to apparently one kind of animal: **humans**.

On the assumption that soul is the cause of life in living things: how can there be a single account of soul, given how many different ways living is spoken of?


### The Unity of Psychology: _De Anima_ 2.3 {#the-unity-of-psychology-de-anima-2-dot-3}

Aristotle showed in _DA_ 2.2 that no univocal definition (of the sort given in _DA_ 2.1) of soul could capture its role as the cause of life in the many ways in which living things are said to live. Instead, we need to study the soul of each kind of living thing individually:

>
>
> _DA_ 2.3, 414b25--28 (Shields tr.)
>
> For this reason, it is ludicrous to seek a common account in these cases, or in other cases, an account which is not peculiar to anything which exists, and which does not correspond to any proper and indivisible species, while neglecting what is of this sort. Consequently, **one must ask individually what the soul of each is, for example, what the soul of a plant is, and what the soul of a man or a beast is.**

This does not mean, however, that there is not unified _science_ of psychology, as opposed to a set of unrelated sciences of botany, zoology, and anthropology. To the contrary, there is a systematic relation among the capacities of soul present in plants, animals, and humans:

>
>
> _DA_ 2.3, 414b29--415a13 (Shields tr.)
>
> What holds in the case of the soul is very close to what holds concerning figures: for **in the case of both figures and ensouled things, what is prior is always present potentially in what follows in a series**---for example, the triangle in the square, and the nutritive faculty in the perceptual faculty. One must investigate the reason why they are thus in a series.
>
> -   For the percepual faculty is not without the nutritive, though the nutritive faculty is separated from the perceptual in plants.
>
> -   Again, without touch, none of the other senses are present, though touch is present without the others; for many animals have neither sight nor hearing nor a sense of smell.
>
> -   Also, among things capable of perceiving, some have motion in respect of place, while others do not.
>
> -   Lastly, and most rarely, some have reasoning and understanding. For among perishable things, to those to which reasoning belongs all the remaining capacities also belong, though it is not the case that reasoning belongs to each of those with each of the others. Rather, imagination does not belong to some, while others live by this alone.
>
> A different account will deal with theoretical reason.

Represented schematically:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/souls.jpg" width="750" >}}

The upshot?
: "The account of each of these [sc. capacities of soul] will also be the most appropriate account of the soul [itself]" (415a14--15).


## 5.2 | Closer to a Scientific Account of Soul {#5-dot-2-closer-to-a-scientific-account-of-soul}

Our discussion of _De Anima_ 2 left off with Aristotle on his way to a significant conclusion: the proper subject of the science of soul is not the soul itself but its constituent _capacities_ --- including the capcities for nutrition, reproduction, locomotion, and thought.

How does he arrive at this conclusion?


### The Unity of Psychology {#the-unity-of-psychology}

Aristotle showed in _DA_ 2.2 that no univocal definition (of the sort given in _DA_ 2.1) of soul could capture its role as the cause of life in the many ways in which living things are said to live. Instead, we need to study the soul of each kind of living thing individually:

>
>
> _DA_ 2.3, 414b25--28 (Shields tr.)
>
> For this reason, it is ludicrous to seek a common account in these cases, or in other cases, an account which is not peculiar to anything which exists, and which does not correspond to any proper and indivisible species, while neglecting what is of this sort. Consequently, **one must ask individually what the soul of each is, for example, what the soul of a plant is, and what the soul of a man or a beast is.**

This does not mean, however, that there is not unified _science_ of psychology, as opposed to a set of unrelated sciences of botany, zoology, and anthropology. To the contrary, there is a systematic relation among the capacities of soul present in plants, animals, and humans:

>
>
> _DA_ 2.3, 414b29--415a13 (Shields tr.)
>
> What holds in the case of the soul is very close to what holds concerning figures: for **in the case of both figures and ensouled things, what is prior is always present potentially in what follows in a series**---for example, the triangle in the square, and the nutritive faculty in the perceptual faculty. One must investigate the reason why they are thus in a series.

Represented schematically:

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/souls.jpg" width="750" >}}

Therefore
: "The account of each of these [sc. capacities of soul] will also be the most appropriate account of the soul [itself]" (415a14--15).


### Consequences of this Conclusion {#consequences-of-this-conclusion}

Aristotle has defended the unity of psychology---i.e., the idea that there is a science of _soul_, understood as a cause of living, over and above the sciences of (e.g.) human life (anthropology), animal life (zoology), and plant life (botany)---by arguing that:

1.  Psychological capcities can be shared by psychological kinds; and that

2.  Psychological capacities exhibit regular patterns of ontological dependence across psychological kinds.

Two important consequences follow from this conclusion.


#### The Soul Operates as Cause of Life Activities in Various Ways {#the-soul-operates-as-cause-of-life-activities-in-various-ways}

>
>
> _De Anima_ 2.4, 415b8--28 (Shields tr.)
>
> The soul is the cause and principle of the living body. As these things are spoken of in many ways, so the soul is spoken of as a cause in the three of the ways delineated: for **the soul is a cause (1) as the source of motion, (2) as that for the sake of which, and (3) as the substance of ensouled bodies.**
>
> -   That it is **a cause as substance** is clear: for substance is the cause of being for all things, and living is being for living things, while the cause and principle of living is the soul. Further, actuality is the _logos_ of that which is potentially.
>
> -   It is evident that the soul is **a cause as that for the sake of which**: just as reason acts for the sake of something, in the same way nature does so as well; and this is its end. And in living beings the soul is naturally such a thing. For all ensouled bodies are organs of the soul---just as it is for the bodies of animals, so is it for the bodies of plants---since they are for the sake of the soul. 'That for the sake of which' is spoken of in two ways: that on account of which and that for which.
>
> -   Moreover, the soul is also **that from which motion** in respect of place **first arises**, though this capacity does not belong to all living things. There are also alteration and growth in virtue of the soul; for perception seems to be a sort of alteration, and nothing perceives which does not partake of the soul. The same holds for both growth and decay; for nothing which is not nourished decays or grows naturally, and nothing is nourished which does not have a share of life.

This consequence brings into clear focus exactly why a generic account of soul would fail to disclose the _way_ in which soul causes living things to live: namely because, depending on the kind of life (or life activity) in question, soul operates as cause in _different_ ways.


#### The Dependencies Among Psychological Capacities Stand in Need of Explanation {#the-dependencies-among-psychological-capacities-stand-in-need-of-explanation}

This is a consequence Aristotle acknowledges several times in _De Anima_ 2:

>
>
> _DA_ 2.2 413b4--10 (Shields tr.)
>
> Being alive, then, belongs to living things because of this principle, but something is an animal primarily because of perception. For even those things which do not move or change place, but which have perception, we call animals and not merely alive. The primary form of perception which belongs to all animals is touch. But just as the nutritive capacity can be separated from touch and from the whole of perception, so touch can be separated from the other senses. By nutritive we mean the sort of part of the soul of which even plants have a share. But all animals evidently have the sense of touch. **The reason why both of these turn out to be the case we shall state later.**
>
> _DA_ 2.2, 413b27--414a4 (Shields tr.)
>
> It is evident from these things, though, that the remaining parts of the soul are not separable, as some assert. That they differ in account, however, is evident; for what it is to be the perceptual faculty is different from what it is to be the faculty of belief, if indeed perceiving differs from believing, and so on for each of the other faculties mentioned. Further, all of these belong to some animals, and som of them to others, and only one to still others. And this will provide a differentiation among animals. **It is necessary to investigate the reason why later.** Almost the same thing holds for the senses: for some animals have them all, others have some of them, and others have one, the most necessary, touch.
>
> _DA_ 2.3, 414b33--415a1 (Shields tr.)
>
> **One must investigate the reason why they are thus in a series.**


### Explaining the Serial Dependencies Among Psychological Capacities {#explaining-the-serial-dependencies-among-psychological-capacities}

Commentators usually look for the promised explanation in _DA_ 3.12--13, where, among other things, Aristotle accounts for the presence of capacities in different psychological kinds by appeal to **hypothetical necessity**:

-   The nutritive soul is necessary for **all living things** to grow and reach (reproductive) maturity.

-   Perception is not necessary for plants, but for animals it is, since without the capacity to perceive:
    -   Animals could not acquire food,

    -   Nor could they achieve "the goal (_telos_) that is the function (_ergon_) of their nature",

    -   Nor could rational animals acquire "a discriminating mind" (_nous kritikos_).

-   Not all of the senses are necessary for every kind of animal, since only animals who need locomotion in order to find food and avoid danger require the distance senses.

-   For these "roaming" animals, moreover, these distance senses are present not only for the sake of being (_to einai_) and survival (_sotēria_), but also for the sake of _well-being_ (_to eu_).

<!--listend-->

Question
: How does this answer the question of (e.g.) why all perceivers are also self-nourishers?


#### A Clue to Aristotle's Strategy {#a-clue-to-aristotle-s-strategy}

>
>
> _De Anima_ 2.4, 415a23--b7 (RFH tr.)
>
> For the nutritive soul belongs also to the others, and is the primary and most common capacity of soul in respect of which living belongs to all. (Its functions are reproducing and [in general] using food.) **For the most natural function for living things – those that are complete and not maimed or have spontaneous generation – is for it to produce another like itself, an animal an animal, a plant a plant, so that they may share as much as possible in the eternal and divine. For all strive for that, and do whatever they do by nature for the sake of that.** (And that for the sake of which is double: on the one hand that of which, on the other that for which.) So, since it cannot share in the eternal and divine in continuity, on account of the inability of any perishable thing to persist one and the same in number, each shares in it as much as it can partake, some more, some less; and not it but something like it persists, not one in number, but one in species.

Question
: What makes it true to say that all living things do everything they do by nature for the sake of sharing as much as possible in the eternal and divine?


Possible Answer
: The end for whose sake living things are endowed with the psychological capacities they naturally have is the activity that represents the best available means for that living thing to participate in the eternal and divine:
    -   For sterile or spontaneously generated animals (non-reproducers), that activity is **nutrition** and **self-preservation**.

    -   For the vast majority of fertile living things, that activity is **reproduction**, or eternal persistence _in kind_.

    -   For rational living things, that activity is **theoretical contemplation** (see _EN_ 10.6--8).


## 5.3 | Matter & Form in Natural Reproduction {#5-dot-3-matter-and-form-in-natural-reproduction}

The Project of _Generation of Animals_
: To consider the moving causes of animals, in particular the generation of each animal and the parts that contribute to animal generation. (_GA_ 1.1)


### Aristotle's Place in the History of Genetics and Embryology {#aristotle-s-place-in-the-history-of-genetics-and-embryology}

Two controversies in the history of embryology:

Preformationism vs. Developmentalism
: Do all the parts of the animal exist is a preformed state (e.g. as a "homonculus") prior to conception and/or birth, or does they develop during gestation?


How does generative seed reproduce manage to generate _all_ the parts of the animal? Some options:
    -   **Panspermia (Hippocratic Treatises, Darwin):** Each part of the body contirbutes to the production of seed.

    -   **Information Theory (Modern Genetics):** Seed encodes _information_ about the plan of the entire body, a plan according to which gestation unfolds.

Aristotle has the honor of being on the right side of both of these debates---a fact which led the Nobel laureate molecular biologist Max Delbrück to propose that Aristotle too be awarded the same prize for "the discovery of the principle implied in DNA":

>
>
> Delbrück 1971, 54--55
>
> Put into modern language, what all these quotations [summarizing Aristotle's position on these debates] is this: The form principle is the information which is stored in the semen. After fertilization it is read out in a preprogrammed way; the readout alters the matter upon which it acts, but it does not alter the stored information, which is not properly speaking, part of the finished product. In other words, if that committee in Stockholm, which has the unenviable task each year of pointing out the most creative scientists, had the liberty of giving awards posthumously, I think they should consider Aristotle for the discovery of the principle implied in DNA.


### The Principles of Aristotle's Embryology {#the-principles-of-aristotle-s-embryology}

As Delbrück alludes to, Aristotle's account of animal generation relies fundamentally on his hylomorphism, and particularly on the idea that the principles of generation, the male and the female, correspond respectively to _form_ and _matter_, the active and passive principles of the process which brings about a new organism.


#### Agency and Patiency in General {#agency-and-patiency-in-general}

In this theory, Aristotle is relying on a general account of motion and change defended in _Physics_ 3.1--3, according to which:

-   Motion (_kinêsis_) is the fullfillment of what is potenially, _qua_ potentially:

>
>
> _Physics_ 3.1, 201a10ff. (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> Thus the fulfilment of what is potentially, as such, is motion—e.g. the fulfilment of what is alterable, as alterable, is alteration; of what is increasable and its opposite, decreasable (there is no common name for both), increase and decrease; of what can come to be and pass away, coming to be and passing away; of what can be carried along, locomotion.

-   The source of motion (the agent or mover) always moves the patient (or that which is moved) by being actually such as the moved is in potentiality.

    >
    >
    > _Physics_ 3.2, 202a6ff. (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
    >
    > Hence motion is the fulfilment of the movable as movable, the cause being contact with what can move, so that the mover is also acted on. The mover will always transmit a form, [10] either a ‘this’ or such or so much, which, when it moves, will be the principle and cause of the motion, e.g. the actual man begets man from what is potentially man.

-   Every motion, then, is the actuality of both a mover (qua agent or mover) and a moved (qua patient or moved). This, however, gives rise to a puzzle: how can the same motion be the actuality of both moved and mover? Aristotle's answer is that **the actuality of the agent and patient are logically distinct aspects of a single motion located in the mover**:

>
>
> _Physics_ 3.3, 202a14ff. (Hardie and Gaye tr.)
>
> The solution of the difficulty is plain: motion is in the movable. It is the fulfilment of this potentiality by the action of that which has the power of causing [15] motion; and the actuality of that which has the power of causing motion is not other than the actuality of the movable; for it must be the fulfilment of both. A thing is capable of causing motion because it can do this, it is a mover because it actually does it. But it is on the movable that it is capable of acting. Hence there is a single actuality of both alike, just as one to two and two to one are the same interval, and the steep ascent and the steep descent are one—for these are one and the same, [20] although their definitions are not one. So it is with the mover and the moved.


#### A Puzzle for Animal Generation {#a-puzzle-for-animal-generation}

This solution is central to resolving an initial puzzle for animal generation, namely:

>
>
> _GA_ 1.21, 729b1 ff. (Platt tr.)
>
> ... how it is that the male contributes to generation and how it is that the semen from the male is the cause of the offspring.
>
> 1.  Does it exist in the body of the embryo as a part of it from the first, mingling with the material which comes from [5] the female?
>
> 2.  Or does the semen communicate nothing to the material body of the embryo but only to the power and movement in it? For this power is that which acts and makes, while that which is made and receives the form is the residue of the secretion in the female.

-   Aristotle's answer is consistent with his solution to the puzzle concerning change in general from _Physics_ 3:

>
>
> _GA_ 1.21, 729b9 ff. (Platt tr.)
>
> Now the latter alternative appears to be the right one both a priori and in view of the facts. For, if we consider the question on general grounds, [10] we find that, whenever one thing is made from two of which one is active and the other passive, the active agent does not exist in that which is made; and, still more generally, the same applies when one thing moves and another is moved. But the female, as female, is passive, and the male, as male, is active, and the principle of the movement comes from him. Therefore, if we take the highest genera under [15] which they each fall, the one being active and motive and the other passive and moved, that one thing which is produced comes from them only in the sense in which a bed comes into being from the carpenter and the wood, or in which a ball comes into being from the wax and the form. It is plain then that it is not necessary that anything at all should come away from the male, and if anything does come away it does not follow that this gives rise to the embryo as being in the embryo, but only as that which imparts the motion and as the form; so the medical art cures the [20] patient.

-   In general, the male principle acts as mover in the process of generation in the way the art of carpentry shapes the wood that comes to be a bed, namely, by imparting a series of motions (embodied in the tools of the carpenter's trade) that act intermediately on the wood:

>
>
> _GA_ 1.22, 730b9 ff. (Platt tr.)
>
> From these considerations we may also gather how it is that the male [10] contributes to generation. **The male does not emit semen at all in some animals, and where he does this is no part of the resulting embryo; just so no material part comes from the carpenter to the material, i.e. the wood in which he works, nor does any part of the carpenter’s art exist within what he makes, but the shape and the form [15] are imparted from him to the material by means of the motion he sets up. It is his hands that move his tools, his tools that move the material; it is his knowledge of his art, and his soul, in which is the form, that move his hands or any other part of him with a motion of some definite kind, a motion varying with the varying nature of the [20] object made. In like manner, in the male of those animals which emit semen, nature uses the semen as a tool and as possessing motion in actuality, just as tools are used in the products of any art, for in them lies in a certain sense the motion of the art.** Such, then, is the way in which these males contribute to generation. But when the [25] male does not emit semen, but the female inserts some part of herself into the male, this is parallel to a case in which a man should carry the material to the workman. For by reason of weakness in such males nature is not able to do anything by any secondary means, but the movements imparted to the material are scarcely strong enough when nature itself watches over them. Thus here nature resembles a [30] modeller in clay rather than a carpenter, for she does not touch the work she is forming by means of tools, but with her own hands.


### Explaining Sexual Dimorphism in Animals {#explaining-sexual-dimorphism-in-animals}

For Aristotle, the principles of animal generation are also the principles of plant generation, the only difference being that the male and female principles are _separate_ from one another in animals (although the unite, plantlike, in copulation).

Aristotle attributes the sexual differentiation of animals to the wisdom of animal nature:

>
>
> _GA_ 1.23, 731a24 ff. (Platt tr.)
>
> **For to the essence of plants [25] belongs no other function or business than the production of seed; since, then, this is brought about by the union of male and female, nature has mixed these and set them together in plants, so that the sexes are not divided in them.** Plants, however, have been investigated elsewhere. **But the function of the animal is not only to [30] generate (which is common to all living things), but they all of them participate also in a kind of knowledge, some more and some less, and some very little indeed. For they have sense-perception, and this is a kind of knowledge.** (If we consider the value of this we find that it is of great importance compared with the class of lifeless objects, but of little compared with the use of the intellect. For against the latter the [731b1] mere participation in touch and taste seems to be practically nothing, but beside plants and stones it seems most excellent; for it would seem a treasure to gain even this kind of knowledge rather than to lie in a state of death and non-existence.) <span class="underline">Now it is by sense-perception that an animal differs from those organisms which have only life. But since, if it is a living animal, it must also live; therefore, when it is [5] necessary for it to accomplish the function of that which has life, it unites and copulates, becoming like a plant, as we said before.</span>

PS
: I suspect that the underlined passage gives us a clue to what A. means when he claims in _DA_ 2.3 that the capacities prior in the series of souls are present potentially in the latter...


Question
: This seems however to be only part of the explanation; we need further to see why the existence of an additional _cognitive_ function in animals accounts for their sexual dimorphism.


To the extent that Aristotle offers an answer, it comes in _GA_ 2.1, where Aristotle claims that sexual differentiation of animal species arises both on account of necessity and for the sake of an end:
    -   **Necessity:** Females are the result of the failure of the male principle to "master" the matter in embryological development; a product of material necessity. (_GA_ 4.1)

    -   **Teleology:** The male and female principles are separate in animals for the sake of the greater perfection of the superior principle, which (for Aristotle) is the male:

>
>
> _GA_ 2.1, 731b24 ff. (Platt tr.)
>
> Now some existing things are eternal and divine whilst others admit of both [25] existence and non-existence. But that which is noble and divine is always, in virtue of its own nature, the cause of the better in such things as admit of being better or worse, and what is not eternal does admit of existence and non-existence, and can partake in the better and the worse. And soul is better than body, and the living, having soul, is thereby better than the lifeless which has none, and being is better [30] than not being, living than not living. These, then, are the reasons of the generation of animals. For since it is impossible that such a class of things as animals should be of an eternal nature, therefore that which comes into being is eternal in the only way possible. Now it is impossible for it to be eternal as an individual—for the substance of the things that are is in the particular; and if it were such it would be eternal—but it is possible for it as a species.
>
> This is why there is always a class of [732a1] men and animals and plants. But **since the male and female are the first principles of these, they will exist in those things that possess them for the sake of generation**.
>
> -   Again, as the first efficient or moving cause, to which belong the definition and the form, is better and more divine in its nature than the material on which it works, it is [5] better that the superior principle should be separated from the inferior.
>
> -   Therefore, wherever it is possible and so far as it is possible, the male is separated from the female.
>
> -   For the first principle of the movement, whereby that which comes into being is male, is better and more divine, and the female is the matter.
>
> -   The male, [10] however, comes together and mingles with the female for the work of generation, because this is common to both.

### Introduction to Embryogenesis {#introduction-to-embryogenesis}

>
>
> _GA_ 2.1, 733b24 ff. (Platt tr.)
>
> There is a considerable difficulty in understanding how the plant is formed out [25] of the seed or any animal out of the semen.
>
> -   Everything that comes into being or is made must (1) be made out of something, (2) be made by the agency of something, and must (3) become something.
>
> -   Now (1) that out of which it is made is the material; this some animals have in its first form within themselves, taking it from the female parent, as all those which are not born alive but produced as a grub or an egg; others receive it [30] from the mother for a long time by sucking, as the young of all those which are not only externally but also internally viviparous. Such, then, is the material out of which things come into being,
>
> -   but we now are inquiring not out of what the parts of an animal are made, but (2) by what agency.
>     -   (2a) Either it is something external which makes them,
>
>     -   (2b) or else something existing in the seminal fluid and the semen; and this must either be
>         -   (2b') soul
>
>         -   (2b'') or a part of soul,
>
>         -   (2b''') or something containing soul.

We consider these questions, and Aristotle's subsequent account of embryogenesis, next week.
