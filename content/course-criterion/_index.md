## Course Description

Is knowledge possible for us, and if so, how? For many epistemologists, both ancient and modern, whether and how knowledge is attainable depends on whether we possess some criterion or standard by which to judge what _is_ the case from what merely _appears_ to be the case. This idea, that knowledge requires a _criterion of truth_, has its origins in antiquity, in Hellenistic debates between so-called Dogmatists and Skeptics about whether human beings possess---or can ever possess---such a criterion. Our aim in this course will be to explore the ancient roots of this "problem of the criterion", in order to gain a better understanding of the various arguments and positions of the dogmatic and skeptical Hellenistic schools, as well as the prehistory of this debate in Hellenic figures such as Protagoras, Democritus, and, more controversially, Plato and Aristotle.

## Course Objectives

The course aims to establish a broad understanding of core issues in ancient epistemology and to develop the skills necessary for appreciating these and other issues in ancient and contemporary philosophy.

## Learning Outcomes

The successful student will demonstrate the ability:

- to state and articulate, verbally and in writing, major ideas and controversies related to ancient epistemology,
- to read and critically assess relevant primary and secondary literature,
- to apply these skills to novel cases.

## Course Components

Students' success in meeting these course goals will be evaluated on the following bases:

- **Undergraduate students** will be expected to write **two passage commentaries**. The commentaries are designed to stimulate in-depth historical and philosophical engagement with one of the major passages discussed in class and relevant secondary literature.

- **Graduate students** will be expected to write _either_ a **passage commentary** and a 12--15 page **final paper** _or_ a 20 page **final paper**. The final paper will address a substantive interpretive issue concerning Hellenistic epistemology and/or related philosophical issues. Topics and secondary literature will be selected in consultation with me.

- Class participation will be evaluated on the basis of the student's answer to periodic **reading response questions**, which will be distributed in advance and must be turned in prior to the start of the meeting in which the relevant reading is to be discussed. (Students may opt out of reading responses with no penalty a maximum of _three_ times; students who do not opt out of three reading responses may use these to replace lower-scoring responses; with the exception of University excused absences, which must be supported by official documentation, students must complete all other reading responses and attend all other class meetings.)

- Finally, students will give at least one 10--15 minute **in-class presentation**. Presentation topics and secondary literature will be selected in consultation with me.
